When I was 11 years old, I was dipped one morning by the sounds of the thumb-of-daughter joy.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual back then, because the news was mostly depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"You can now go to a real school," he said.
I will never forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was stumbling for five years as a boy, and my older sister who couldn't have been on their own, to a secret school.
Only that's how we could go to school, we could go to school.
We took another way every day so nobody could guess where we were going.
We are hiding our books in shopping bags so it looked like we were just going to go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
Over and over again, the class had to come out for a week because the Taliban had been discharged.
We never were sure how much they knew about us.
Did they succeed us?
Do you know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky enough to grow up in a family where education was important and women were valued.
My grandfather had a long time ahead of his time.
An outsider from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was violated by his father.
But my mother was a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she was in retirement, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received a school.
And it was always clear for him that his children would receive an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much greater risk of sending his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by our lives, of course, of the constant fear and the perspective of life.
I was a good one to give up, but my father said, "Toy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced from your house in war.
But one thing that will remain you is that what's in this room, and even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree as a Sekundar degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly Christian of the Worldbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people that I was confering.
He's not just a secretist of my college degree, but also because I was the first woman who's driving him with the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helped to start the CDLA, the first and maybe the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school girls are still riskful.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to see the potential opportunities they're offering.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents then did for me, despite all the other and opposite causes of war.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students's father.
And just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and she's dying from a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he got to my home, the phone rings, and a voice attacked him, if he was sending his daughter to school, she would try it again.
He said, "Now, if you want, I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game because of your old and over-written ideas."
In fact, in Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often being rejected in the West: the way most of us have succeeded is a father who recognizes the value of their daughter and realizes that their success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't really mean to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are beginning to be very compelling and compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term and they're changing with the decline of the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents, who are using them, they are encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is my country of hope and the unconcited possibilities, and every day, the girls who visit SOLA.
Just like I do, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a profession -- my life was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971, 1977, I see young, but I don't -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, in projects of engineering with African countries.
I've been working for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on my legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we're Italian, good people, and we're earning good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we were doing.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples at Zambezi," was one where we used to show people of the Sambias, how food is being developed.
We were with Italian seed in Southeast Asia, in this shorthand valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We were teaching the local population to grow Italian tomatoes and to Bechini.
Of course, the local workers didn't have any interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were surprised that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Wait time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these amazing tomatoatoes. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Torambers, "Look, just how agriculture is."
When the tomato was rusty and red, about 200 nousles of jellyfish came out of the river night, and they were all over the end.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the niliest one!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you tell us this?" You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian, so we were so great, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French people did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We actually put the nilos at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we didn't have the restless African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, she's a post-bian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the world's population to the African continent and 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money did.
Just read their book.
So think about a African woman, what we did.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we colonize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both of these words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I suffer every other culture as though they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisative: I suffer every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "bwana," are called the boss.
I was a beloved kid when I read the book "mall's Beautiful" by puppying. He said, most importantly, in economics, when people don't want help, let them stay.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Today, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the floor, and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neococolial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I created a system called business capital, which never was initiated, never gets someone motivated, but you become the service of the local talent, the talent of the local people, the dream of being a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with a local home hall.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafes. We're in Kneipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We're closing friends and finding out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can convey one idea.
If this person doesn't like, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing for humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why not, rather than coming into a community and saying to people what they should do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have entrepreneurs, and they never will say publicly what they want to do with their money, what they're going to see for opportunities.
You have this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We're working to one to do this, needs to be created by social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the village of the company, the local family of the company, who is sitting with you in the house, with your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the tools to change your passion in a way that will be transformed.
I tried this in a sectance, Western Australia,
I tweeted at the time, and I tried to escape the shoring flaws where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets in the first year, and within three days, my first three days, I helped him. He was a fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came to the street, and he said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?
I helped these five fishermen, working together, and this wonderful tuna, not to sell a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million, but to Japan at Sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them?" Can you help us?
I had 27 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go through loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best corporate workers in history died with 96 years ago.
Peter's a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Make is really incompatible with a social society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurs's spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you to one.
You have to provide them disclosion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For what presentation did you bet the most cheer tomorrow?
"Done, passionate people. You applaud them.
I'd like to tell you that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the deceptable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn motor engine is not sustainable.
The Freon Art of Environment is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, to be able to transport, to transport them with them.
The technologies aren't there.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget.
The government? Forget it.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they were replicated, which was going to happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? Well, you looked at the curve and said, when the population grows on this speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to be done with the crap of six million horses.
Because they were already going under the crap.
1860 they see the dirty technology that leaks life from New York City.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you have to do is to have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is provide them absolute, engaged and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest and the biggest company, all of them have to be able to perform three things: that must be a grand-etic product, which has to be great, and the financial law enforcement has to be huge.
You know what?
We never met one person who is currently producing something, selling and taking care of money.
This is not something that is happening.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that only successful companies have in common with the world, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16 students in North Korea entrepreneurship, and we start to teach them the lessons to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons autobiography, and the job of the 16 undergraduate is to support the first two pages of Richard Bransons autobiography as often as the word "hith" and often the word "h."
Never "I" and 32 times we are."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background, sit in cafes and bars, and their engaged buddy, who are going to do what someone for this gentleman did for this Christian man who talks about this. Somebody talks about this. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do this." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have teams of volunteers who are supporting corporate organizations to help them find out the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of the people's intelligence in the population can be changed and the economy of this community, only by starting to capture the passion and power of their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be, Alice must be in the miracle country.
Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- asking engineers to divide in communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid that these students are scared of their large brains and their large books and their big, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was slipped down to the case of a pighole and saw a door in a whole new world.
And I felt just the same time when I was having conversations with the students, and I was surprised by the thought they had, and I wanted others to discover this wonder of this wonderful country.
I believe that to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are addressing our greatest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's going to be in our responsibility as a scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I'd like to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, what?
Tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
It's not just that it tells us that their graves are studying, but it tells us that their graves, the skin-like structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat osteopocrosis.
And if you describe what you're doing, then you're using useless words.
Writing words are a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use your tidy-life and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're not going to be able to understand your thoughts, it's not the same as stealing your level.
As Einstein said, "Well, things just as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, a few things about this is, examples, stories and analogies, in this way, you can pull us into your boss.
And when you present your work, you'll take the dots out.
Have you ever asked why it's called "reverse point?"
What happens when someone gets to look at? Another one is going to be stabbed, and with those dots, the first one is your audience.
I'm a slide like this, not only is it boring, but it also also puts very much on the conversation about our brains, and by doing so, we're quickly challenged.
This is a picture of Geneberve Brown that is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the worm is so stable that it even became the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy, playful sentence where the audience is once they're losing the thread, and the graphics and graphics that are also prescribed to address our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what they think is.
These are just a few of the ways that we can help us open up these towers and see the wonders of the country that is spreading science and technology.
Because the engineers I taught you were taught to make the <unk>the Hotel tight in me<unk> I'd like to sum up all the things with a equation.
If you look at your science and your critics, you look at them, you're going to be divided by the relevance, and so the audience says, what's important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work, and that's what's going to make you feel incredible about it, and it's going to be really unimaginable about the different interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really looking for it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a cell phone with a drug of crime in human Syria.
You can tweet a cell phone, you can post a message and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a cell phone and you can take a song, you can upload it to soundoud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year of a year of turn in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed them to change.
We were in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who were coming through and asking change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. an Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Every one of them has a cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone and my cell phone wants to talk about how my life changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines, all the information.
We have raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. embassy has set out a policy line.
So this is a policy line for the protection of defense control.
And the key is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who sends an email? Who sends an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And when you use a cell phone, where you're a cell phone.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And all over Europe, people were up there and saying, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this protection system.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were racing out on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be a case at Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Chimpolizei in eastern Germany.
And I also wondered, is this really working?
Can all of this information really flows all over us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German Tele-Actor, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, I ask them, I'd send all the information that saved you over me.
And I once asked her, and she again, and she didn't get the right answer. Just the more blue Bla Blaaa.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening with it.
So I decided to put a legal court process on it because I wanted this information.
But the German post said no, we're not going to give you this information.
And it ended up with a comparison with them.
I'm going to pull back the counter-section of what they were sending me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court official decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what I was doing.
35830 lines of information.
So I saw it first, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life on this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called the protection control of the law enforcement.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to C<unk>nn<unk>s, and how many calls I'm going to do on the way.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and call them a different one.
And after a while, you call yourself up and you call them, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to whom to email an email is, all of this is possible when you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I first said, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leader was, it might have never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And even after that, the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies today want to store so many of the information that they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all long.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is an issue of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to tell your foreignman, just because companies and government areas have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they saved you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight for self-determination in digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral-thrined, rapid-piving restaurants, Brakalls.
So the city planers come together and they thought about changing the name of South Central Central so that it would be for something else, it would change it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes in terms of what's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
In total, locals, rapid-piving restaurants, bureaucratic spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Canada, home from the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The amazing thing is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the most unpredictable conditions.
For example, obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't face that anymore.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the bee-suppled system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to find out that skier is purchased and sold like use trucks.
I see a cartooning center going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it must stop.
I realized that the problem is to solve.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I was going to get a apple that's not mediated by the number of pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park.
It's 45 feet in the order of three feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got to my group, the L.A. Green Grips, and we started planting my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of pre-performance group, connected from gardening all the social layers and from all the city, it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a pre-contet, and said I had to remove my garden, the waiting car was a legitimate configuration.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
Give a narrative of how to grow food on a piece of land that you're completely not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her her way."
Because this time, it wouldn't be.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez did a story about it, and with a member of Green Ground Ground, they signed a petition on Change.org, and we succeeded with 900 protons.
We stopped the victory in their hands.
My city bank even called it, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has the most of the palms in the United States in the property of the city.
They have 25,000 miles in the metal space.
This is 20 Central parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell wouldn't they find it OK?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my cure, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more ashamed to be part of these preconceived reality, made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Gardenwork is my graffiti. I'm going to plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls are sweating, I'm going to wipe lawn and park equipment.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants, and the trees are my pledge for these kinds of stuff.
You'd be surprised, what can the ground floor be if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've seen my garden as an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how children are affected by it.
Parort of outsiders is the most therapeutic and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you get strawberry straws.
I remember that time that this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I got out and I looked at them like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not reason on the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you don't worry about people being steal."
And I said, "Aye devil, no, I'm not afraid they're squeaking.
It's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
And at another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to buy the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it affected them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it only changed for a moment.
Green grass has already planted about 20 gardens.
And in our retrofitting programs, 50 people came along and did this, and it's all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't have any of them, if they didn't show them how food and body affects them, they blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
I see the gardening of the garden as an opportunity where we can train these kids to care about their communities to live a sustainable life.
And when we do, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take ship carts and turn them into healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snuck because free is not sustainable.
The thing about sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and letting them experience the joy and the honor of getting food built, and when you open farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, ghost-hers.
We have to turn the image of the weather of the gang.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
First of all, you're going to be a wrestling, right?
And let's be the gun of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit in smart chairs and have a meeting where you talk about making any cheeks.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skate, in my backyard, so that we can plant any cheeks.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And it's "nnnnnnnnjoster" means "the unconventional politicians."
Even though a newspaper host was awarding a better definition in the 19th century, "A Snollygoster is someone who is planning a office, independent of side, program or command, and success, and succeeding by the only power of the monopoly-s signature vulnerability."
I have no idea what is a toy.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for instance, the British Parliament were allowed to find out, the same word "written" was not the same word of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, which was about to develop the parliament.
They threw it into the Tower of London, and they gave it a little bit of a trick, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to commute, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so strong like Brass." Many people believe.
And it's a big deal for the English word for the wheel.
But that's not true. It's a convicted of the freedom of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you with the United States, at the time when it's just been passed independence.
And you saw the question of, how do you call George Washington, the head of the head?
You didn't know.
What's called the leader of a universal nation?
There has been an accident in Congress that was forever disputed for a long time.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions that you could do.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, their high-valness of George Washington, and again, other people's freedom of freedom from the United States of America.
Not so much of a sensitive one.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought it was a good thing to do.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was a little bit bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the diary's journal, and I was writing the same topic all the time. I said, "I'm still going to have the same subject."
The reason for the delay, and the boredness was that the representatives house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want to.
King, and maybe even give it to ideas about it, to follow it.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most ruthless, most horrifying titles that they thought about.
This was a cover name.
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But it only meant that someone was being a gathering.
Like, the precautionary of a jury.
He didn't have the size anymore than the term "written" or "wug water."
Sometimes there were little president of the chiefs of the world, and there were new civil society groups, but it was really a misrepresentative title.
And so the Senate refused to do it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign a treaty and meet foreign sales.
Who will take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't go.
Instead, the reason that you didn't think of the word "glity," is to say they were totally clear that they were not meant to be honest about their honest respect for opinions and institutions of civilized nations, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's the office of the state of Honor, not necessarily for the president of the nation.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First of all, and I think that's the best -- so far, I can't figure out if the Senate ever has officially validated the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has only called the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says something temporary -- you're waiting for 223 years later.
And thirdly, this is really important, this is the most important thing, is that the theme of America today is not so humbling, right?
This has a little more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They've got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the caution of self-hood -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the undercover house lost, because nobody feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'm going to leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually, words change much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 rairters in combat with Mr.jalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I would be able to paint my black Conclight Match against a pair of brown leatherers and hit a rocket towards the government's path that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For the long time, I'd been a big deal with the war, but with Pyjama parties and football talks to Samens and Woveries of South Africa and di-cological protests who never lived with communism and Afghanistan for years, I knew what I was doing.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing here, I'm a man-wreated, I'm a man-made, I'm a Russian-stov, and a radical political artist who's been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rain shows. I want to do art that draws personality and authority and re-writing and re-writing reality and even using a kind of a creative people to try and understand the world that we live in.
I'd like to spend a day in a jihad -- the people that are doing jihad against the organization like "Pople Blood" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad strike do when the parliament is to do a job and do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I going to hire me! I'm jihad, and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow these Mafiosi to be able to get away as a national hero.
I want to go to the bottom-off corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "recapeing," where you're a cop, a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money and in the names of Kabul, we hope that they would be 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, in terms of the world of engineering conflict.
The war and the stranger who came to him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion investigator for soldiers and suicide bombers, in the barbed of indigenous Afghan dressers with a protected and several recycled possession in a super-driving mode.
And I'd like to see what a simple ripple of Kabul looks like between 181 Appell's Appell to create a dialogue that today's development-based origins have its origins in the past colonial rhetoric about the White Man's "The Beem" to protect the brown man from itself and even to survive a little bit of civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, you can misrepresented, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I felt like I was building an uncomfortable tension in this room, because I wouldn't have been able to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I'm going to have a little more approach.
This is the first time someone comes to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see this, I think.
If some women were really really upset when I came out, you don't need me to tell me this now, I read it later on Twitter.
I also find that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
Nobody has the chance of that.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to move the sweater over my head, because you're all going to wake me off, so you don't do anything, as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not, hopefully, as awkward as this picture.
It's a visual image, but it's a visual image, it's also superficial.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should throw my back and hold my hand in my hair of this guy.
And beyond the surgery or the wrong thing that I had, two days ago, I was able to do this, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and our expressions have the basis, even though it's super-ficial and ineffective -- a large impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable for me is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the more honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason, as I became a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which we are biologically programmed, but as a large, shining, feminine and brightness.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was being paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion concerts may call "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu."
And first I'm going to comment on your model. Very impressive.
But I'm afraid that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that have been counted on, each one of them, and that in 677 were only 27 or less than four percent of the world.
The next question that's always been asked to me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown up?"
And I say to you, "I don't know, it's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-Barming expert, which is completely wrong, because you're the first one."
And when they say about this amazing counter-mover, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
And to say that you want to be a model later, it's like you're going to say you're going to get the Jackossto in the lottery.
You can't do it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I'm going to show you 10 years of working models, because, unlike heart surgeons, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture to run," now the leg goes first, and long, long, long, long, long, that arm goes back, and on the back, you're on the side of your head, and you just move back to three foot, and you're going to see like, 300 times, you're going to
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and have a life and have a few jobs, you can't say a lot anymore. If you say that you want to be president of the United States, but in life, "10 years of underwear," you're going to see a little bit of weird.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Who is going to release all the photos?"
And yes, almost all of these photos are being cleaned, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the Shootings.
My girlfriend had to be challenged.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a Shooting for French birdia.
This is me with the football team and the New Yorker magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructed, and it's constructed by a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeup artists and the photographers and the Stylists and all their assistants and the evaluation. They're programming. This is not me.
Okay, next, when people always ask me, "Do you fight for nothing?"
Yes, I have too many 20-c-mix shoes that I can't carry, except just, but the things I get free are things that I get in real life and I don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I forgot my money, and I gave myself the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was overheard a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took me to say, "Excuse me, Mr. Winner champions," and we could go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance, and there are people who are looking at it and not because of their personality, they're paying a high price.
I live in New York, and we live in the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and shot last year, 85 percent of black men and Latino, and most young men.
In New York, it only only 17,000 young, male and Latinos, who don't ask the question, "Am I listening?"
But, "How often am I going to stop? When am I going to stop?"
In my research on this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number is up at 78 percent, when they're turned 17 percent.
The last question I'm saying, "How is it like to be a model?"
And I think you'll expect this answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and shiny hair, you feel very happy and fulfilled."
And then we'll give backups a response that might be maybe imposing this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
Everything that is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never tell before the camera, what I never said before, is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling feeling because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had little legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some of the models, because they have the most thin legs and the most awkward hair and the coolest filament, and they are probably the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to get me to have a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable at the one hand, and I said, "I got all the benefits of a pile that had been pushed into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to add, "And it always makes me happy."
It was very difficult, especially, to give a legacy of antique and race when I'm one of the greatest users of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years, and my career has passed on, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I was going to get my first job, or I wouldn't be able to tell, like I was spending college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our misbeherstood and misbeherstanding.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who had come to life in exile, "Son, gaddafafafi resistance. Being him.
But I will never be a bit like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's now almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been replicated, inspired by the waves of mass operations both in the Tunisian and in the Egyptian revolution.
I would connect with many other Libyans, within and outside the world, to challenge a day of anger, to start a revolution against the tyrannic regime of Gadrosis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Lebanby women and men were in the first row, and asked the end of the regime, Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice stopped.
They proved excellent courage by being put against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the east to the distant west, to the South.
After a period of six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and to overrange the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a huge brush, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed tyrannal regimes and the infrastructure, and also the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I rented, as many other women, to rebuild the civil society of Lybia, and we challenged a participatory and legitimate transition to democracy and national.
Nearly 200 organizations have been founded while and immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started working video imaging to organize human development and leadership skills.
I started a wonderful group of women, a team of women's peace-based peace collection, a movement of women, leaders from different lives, whose goal is to be public, public for the societic Convention, and to be on the basis of women, to be the right with the judging of democracy and peace.
And I met a very difficult environment with the elections, a very difficult environment, which was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a initiative to the peace platform of prime men to achieve a rating law, a law that would be a citizen, whatever background it should be to vote and to vote, and mainly for political parties, between a female and female, on the horizontal level, and to make a complete account.
At the end, our initiative was over and successfully.
Women won 175 percent of the national justice officer in the first elections for 52 years.
But surely, the euphority of elections and the whole revolution for <unk> because every day we were taking new messages on violence.
We were a morning of commuting about ancient mosques and Sufi boys.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of American ambassador and attack on the message.
Then another morning, the murder of the army was signed.
And really every day, we were facing the tyranny of the military and their ongoing causes against human rights prisoners and their deficuation of laws and laws.
Our society shaped by a revolutionary mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, liberty, dignity, social justice -- that they had initially ended up with.
Intent, perseverance and riff became the icons of the Folian era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success history of our failed list and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, who has made false choices and wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security in Lybias.
Did the urge to have the banted list and the shift between female and male candidates and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
So what is it?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate our society by selfish politics of dominance and disreguse, both men and women?
Perhaps the women weren't the only thing that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the confession.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus when it took the elections, which has only been strengthening the polarization and the agility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of the anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't only value, but it also has to be attributed: Gnade instead of revenge, cooperation, instead of competition, instead of rejection.
These are the ideals that need one of the raviated lybias to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemia, it's about the transcendent of feminine and masking view.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do this in existential ways before we do it sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, raw."
The word "raheheem," again, which is known throughout the late days of the past, has the same Arab root as the word "mir" and symbolized the mother's mother's mother's mother's grandmother who surs all around the world, who is the man of the man's and the female, and all of the peoples have died.
And just like the mother's assurance of the embryo growing in it, the principal of compassion is the sole of all of its existence.
So we were told, "My Gnade is going to include all the things."
So we were told, "My Gnade has prevented my desty."
Let's all of us be the art of the gistar.
Thank you.
When I was a young one, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were doing the story of Kim Kim Cl Ilung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until a whole change of time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from my mother, the sister of a colleague of mine.
And it said, "If you were watching this, our five family members will not be in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
I was going to the station, and I went through the station, and I saw something horrible I can't delete from my memory.
A blind woman was lying on the ground, and a child in her arm was a glowing helpless one in her mother's face.
But nobody helped them because everybody was busy taking care of themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were sick of famine, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and trees were burned.
Now, traffic accidents have become more and more common, so at night, everything was going to be darling me, except the lights of China on the other side of the user's population that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river Amroc, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very smooth, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many of them die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took me 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as young girls without family.
I didn't have any idea about what life would be like North Carolina refugees, but soon I realized it's not just incredibly difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Koreans are going to be seen refugees in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny of North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was perceived when I was caught by the Chinese police police officer and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be the North Koreore, so they tested my Chinese events and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
If anything is unnatural, I could be imprisoned and signed.
I thought that that was the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they were done with the questions, a prosecutor said to the other, "That was a misdirection.
She's not an Northstorean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are searching for foreign messages likeyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police police and signed.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they eventually were released because of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China being caught and signed up to North Korea, where they were tortured, imprisoned or engaged in public.
Even though I was lucky, I was lucky, many other North Koreans don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard for survival.
After she's learned a new language and she's found work, the world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, leaving myself in South Korea, a greater challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And of course, I've seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very diverged by 67 years of sharing.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean agents?
Where am I coming from? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no more land that could have been my home.
Even though the adaptation of the South Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of the university.
Just when I was treated on my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx authorities started to remove the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved, in a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to leave an incredible route on their way to liberty.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironry, I took a flight back to China, and I got to the north-Sore border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles through China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got almost several times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the evidence of all of them, and started asking questions.
Because my family didn't really understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer promised my family, I was determined, and he said that they were gay, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to do it all the way to the lazeic border, but I had to almost go through all my money to bribe the border routes of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After having paid money and bribing money, my family was released within a month, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, the capital of Laos.
This was one of the greatest disadvations of my life.
I'd done everything to protect my family to liberty, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the south-dathan message.
I went and I went between the foreign police department and the police department, and I was trying to desperately clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for the money to pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger was taking care of it.
I was struck by a dictionary, and I was able to tell my situation and to kill it, and he went to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him for all-hearted heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I will help the North Carolina people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The earlier stranger of mine had shown me a new hope that the North Koreans needed so badly, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
And eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited again in South Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start with little or little money at all.
The international community can help us in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family users, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea from inside.
I was so fortunate to have as much help and inspiration in my life that I would want to be hopeful about making North Koreans succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans all over the world, even on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and it's very well-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it with discomfort, and he divided it.
He's not greedy. He doesn't listen to the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and it's just about you: He never tells a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to think words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about minds and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It's got absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate, but he reminds me of the paper year of every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, while the first episode of the teapbbbies on my arm was to have my grandma and Gagas's birthday.
Don't they hear it incredibly amazing?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what I've encouraged my heart was to strengthen my soul was that although this was the case, although they were not normally considered, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "critism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and physical skill.
It's a different part of each individual, and it's a different part of it, and it's called Remi's so different from the Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, it's been noticed in a new person of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing organisms in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was a lot of screaming.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran into his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a room, putting the washing machine in and eating everything that was coming under him.
And as he got older, it became different and different from the differences that were more visible.
But behind the anger and the fry and the silent hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being who never had otherwise been.
Remarkably remarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wished I was that they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different, doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it's like you're not going to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it, and all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress, change, is dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else is.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Doc Edgerton was filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo on a project of an apple, and with a de-fight time, it was only one millionth of the year.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new engineering technology that is so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look at the other side of our view, or we can't look at the corners of the screen or see an <unk>-ray in our body, and really ask what we mean with "mamera"
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I light it in a billionth of a second -- this is several number of Femtoseconds -- I create a package of photons that are barely a millimeter, and this photon package, this project will move into speed, and it will move on a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this project, you take this photons package and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think, the whole event is actually taking less than a nanosis -- so long as you have to go back this track -- but I'm going to try to highlight this video to the factor of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So this film is going to happen a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, starts in the bottle with a photon package, which starts to move through and melt through, and eventually breaks inside.
Part of the light is flowing out of the table, and you see this spread on the waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the trigger of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of a flair that's going to be flipping around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
Now, if you take a standard project and leave it all the same way back and slow the video back to 10 billion, you know, how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One week? No, a year.
This is a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about some still-time photography?
You can see again, these waves are on the table, the Tomces and the wall draining over the back of the back.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature was drawing a photo like this, each of the time a Femto image, but of course our eye looks a couple of frames.
But if you look at these Tomva, you'll see that when the light is slipping the Tomva, it's going to keep it apart. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is ripe and the light jumps around you and after a few billion seconds, it comes back.
So in the future, if this tapto camera is embedded in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out if a fruit is closed without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short-term of air, you have very little light, but we're going to make a billion times faster than your shortest calpime, so you're going to get as good as you don't get light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon package, a million times, and we're drawing this over and over again with very clever synchrony, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superheroes, can they see the edges?
The idea is that we emit something slightly light on the door.
It's going to be rebel, go into the room, it's reflected in a part of it, it's reflected back on the door, and then eventually it's going to turn back to the camera, and we can use these more magnifational twists of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
You can see the red side of our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, there's a puppet hidden, and we're going to let the light go out on the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications, it was released by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be rewinding this light project, and they're going to push it on this wall, and this photonocone package is going to be all over the way, and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden soup that will break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons of the photons, but it will be very, very, very, very, very,
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-use solution, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
By taking a laser, we can take a laser, we can take a raw image of what you see on the screen -- it doesn't really make sense, but then when we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the various light-sight, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got a lot of work before we can do this from the lab, we can build cars that are preventing collisions and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can search for it in dangerous offspring, by looking at light, and we can see the window through the open window or we can build endcopes in the body, right to Kardo.
But because of the blood pressure and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, and that's really a term for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like at Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art of ultra-mouth photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collected every time, not only for the scientific process. We can also create a new form of computer photography with color and time-time time-time imagery, and we can only look at the waves between ourselves.
But it's something fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottleneck, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turned out that we're almost in light speed, we've got some strange effects, and Einstein would have liked to have this picture.
The sequence that happens in the world of events appears in the camera in reverse order, in terms of applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So no matter whether photography is there to travel around images or creation a new visualization of medicine or new forms of development since our invention has been able to open all the data and details on our website, and hope that the licensers, the creative and the research community, we should stop showing that we should start to start to start to the megapixels of the nextframe camera and the next two dimensions.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that many of the deliberations don't get passed, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and valves and crosses and crosses.
The projects were created from my questions, how much rented my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we divide our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the vast shalties that have been ejected to the hundreds of years of loving, gay and woolly and junior, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned bottles in America.
I live near this house thinking about how I can make it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity of the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to hold that view every day.
It's easy to lose and forget about what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard, and I wrote with a treasure of the blankb, "I'd die," I want everybody to come back, I can take a piece of chalk, and I can be able to think about their life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and grew.
I'd like to share some of the sentences that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to be a broad-time person about the International World Cup."
"I'd be mortal, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm going to die, I want to live in a mesh-control."
"I'm going to die, I want to keep it in my arms again."
"I'd be mortal, I want to be somebody's cavalry."
"I'm going to die, I want to be myself."
This is a place that was neglected, and it was a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people were brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for the first, thinking and remembering what's most important as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a kit in the world, and now in countries like K Kasazhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to spread our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasingly overcoming distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthens us.
And the idea of death is that we can tell the life.
Our common spaces are the best to show what's important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in my work with a related math. I'm a special problem for anyone who's been involved in making-related mathematics is that we're like business leaders.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I'm doing.
We're a man's most human activity.
We are thrilled to look at the masterious ballett and beers, as you'll see.
So for the ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying these extraordinary ability. It's also what she does to my people who were a man-dominated protriple who was a ballet moment for him.
Over the years, you've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the most disqubodied symptoms like weakness, abson, pearl and others living with this disease, so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
Now, trouble is that there are no biomarkers for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is, this is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it never will.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test itself?
It wouldn't be a expensive hospital staff.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to go into the neurological department.
So I'd like to propose to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in some sense, virtual-free like my-fired Janripling.
Here you see a video of the vibrating vocal sound.
This is what happens in the healthy condition when someone is creating a speech. We can look at ourselves as a coherent ballet dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we can make sound, and we all have genes for it. FoxP2.
And like Ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it's learning.
We can tell the sound of the sound, we can tell the position of the vibrating vocal sound, and like the limbs are also affected by the vocal muscles of Parkinson's disease.
In the lower term, you can see an example of irregular vocal sounds of evidence.
We see the same symptoms.
Difficult, weakness, ealsiness.
The language will even be more fry and fuzzy over time, and that's an example of it.
Now, the effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision disorder analysis, combined with new machine learning that is now highly advanced, we can now see where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the sounds of the voice.
How can these tests measure clinicalize? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
It's also little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are accurate. They're not doing the same thing about experts.
So you can be done independently.
They're very, very quickly, very quickly, at the top of 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is really cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
These amazing goals can be done with this.
We can reduce logististic difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do cheap amounts of mass care for clinical trials, and we're going to have a study for the whole population first.
We have now the ability to look for the disease for the first time before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, we're going to start Parkinson's voice-driven.
With aculab and patient's DayMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the success of these goals.
We have Rufnars, which are freely accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease, can call it cheaply to leave images for a few cents. I'm known to be blessed with fun, that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can tell who you're healthy and who you are not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient in the phone has to tell if this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database of these, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are in order to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is about it?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to blame him because he did this fantastic work -- has shown now that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call the phone with the phone, call the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back of the back, you see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a small place in the south, which means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was a terrible thing. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we were with our animals and the Norwegian rainforest on the sky, so our animals care so much.
Ever as a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our terrorist atheist. They protect our tribe and our ancestry. They're also dedicated to this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only a few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years, is responsible for his father's cows. So I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was on the cow's edge.
But lions are very clever animals.
They come, they see the bird search and go back, and the next time they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
I stopped the Stall one night. I was walking around with a racket in my hand, and this time, the lions didn't catch.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea. I had an idea.
Even as a young boy, I was working in my room all day, and once again I took the new radio of my mother, and the day it almost took me around, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a driver-based carrier, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I turned a switch to turn the lights out and turn it off.
This is a little pear of pearl from a broken flaphlight lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar elephant is actually carrying the battery, which is the battery, providing electricity to the correct agent. I call it a transneuron.
And the right-to-the-brain is a blind.
You can see that the pearl shows outwards, because it comes from there to lions.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are blinking, and the lions believe I'm going around the wreck, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this at home, and since then, we had no more trouble with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've since fed seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they work really well.
My idea is now used throughout Kenya, including other predators like hyena or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep elephants remotely from farms.
My invention helped me to a fellowship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps with fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights back together, where there's no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
One year, I only took a boy from the savanna, who was cursing his cows. I looked at airplanes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of my dogs!"
And here I am.
I was able to get a plane to get my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to hear lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can do it together. We can live on the side with lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk>n. In my language, Oln. I'm very much.
You don't know what it's so exciting to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical invention.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electrical fence. An electroencephalial?
Yes, I know, electrical jellyfish has been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, you don't really -- yes, I've tried it, but I've been back to the trial because I got a --
First, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you on every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now, since I'm old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorites, and not one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way to shoot one more time, not even taking the lighting.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by randomly-wounded tourists.
My story started when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I would hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this goes beyond ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up to say, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina in New York and do a father-dad's boss, and they're going to continue to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking to ask by asking the Norwegian tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is, when you're going to be able to get a complete stranger and you're going to have a camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody has ever been touched with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This one was taken just weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a record moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a possibility for us for a week in October, keeping time and thinking about our time and how we're going to change the year, not only physically, but in everything.
Because whenever we do the same picture, our view changes as time as time, as it's always reached new milestone, I can see life with their eyes as it relates to everything and how it sees.
This very intense time we spend on each other is something we value and expect every year.
The latest thing that happened was that one of our trips, we walked out and suddenly remained as if they were, it shows a red mark on a larcar on a dollboard that had learned as a little kid, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old, that's what she thought was.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York for high schools because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized, obviously, the most important thing we all created is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides these 15 pictures, I'm not at very little of a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I'd like to encourage each of you today to come up with this image, and don't you mind asking someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.51, 56.1/32.6/20.4/12.8 (BP=0.970, ration=0.971)
