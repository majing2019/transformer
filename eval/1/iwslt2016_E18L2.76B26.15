When I was 11 years old, one morning I was consumed by the sounds of thumb-eek.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was largely depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I turned out to be a boy for five years, and I was left with my older sister who was no longer allowed to go on a secret school.
and we could just go to school.
We took another way every day so nobody could guess where we went.
We hid our books in shopping bags so it looked like we were just going to go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And every single time, the class had to drop out for a week because the Taliban had been crippled.
We never really knew how much they knew about us.
Are they advising us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was lucky enough to grow in a family where education was important and distributed daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send my daughter -- to school and was rejected by his father.
My mother was educated but she was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- you see here -- the first thing in his family was ever given an education.
He was always very clear that his children would get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much bigger risk to send his children to school.
I know right now that in the years of the Taliban, sometimes I was frustrated by our lives, and I was frustrated by the constantly fear and the transluctity.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Toy, Dad, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed in war from your house.
But one thing you'll be with is that what's in this, and even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we'll do that.
So -- Do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree as a Sekundar degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I stand here today as a proudly Christian to the Freedombury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he missed his wife to send his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulations.
He doesn't just push me with high school, but also to say that I was the first woman to be to drive him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even more dreams for me.
And so I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, who is a global campaign for women's education.
And so I helped build SOLA, the first and possibly the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school paper is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to perceive the opportunities they're offering.
And seeing their parents and fathers as they were, as my parents then, for me, despite all the other and opposite odds.
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was out on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they were out of death in the street just by a few minutes.
When he came to his home, the phone rang and a voice signed him if he left his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "Well, now if you want, I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game because of your old-fashioned and overstated ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often not appreciated in the West: Behind most of us, the success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and the conscious that her success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't really matter in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are starting to come and be convincing to be a very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
The Taliban went to school for a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be from America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid the change are not over the long term, and it's changing all the way through the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents, who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan, to me, is a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities, and every day, it reminds me of the girls who go to SOLA.
Just as I have, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a profession -- my life -- was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I see young, but it's not -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on projects of engineering with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on my legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, thought that we're an Italian good person and that's a good job in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we started.
Our first project, which was inspired by my first book, "Ripples on Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show people in Italy to Sambias how food is being grown.
We came to Italian seed in Southeast, in this sliding valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population to grow Italian tomatoes and to Bechini.
Of course, the localities had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they did.
We were amazed that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Wait time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything is wonderfully in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the sambers, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red, over night, about 200 nilocks from the river came out and over everything.
We said to the Sambites, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian, so it was great for thorns in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French guys did, and after I saw what they did, I became pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We would put in the booth at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we have not delivered to the restless African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a Sudanian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money had done.
Just read their book.
Check out about a African man, what we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, and we colonize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root, which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat each culture in another, as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisative: I suffer each other's culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "baked" in Africa.
I was cursed when I read the book "mmallall" by singing laughter. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, they keep them alone.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, set up a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolous?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to people and to create a system called business promotion, which never gets started, never gets motivated, but you become the local passion, the local man's dream, the dream of becoming a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit down with the local.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafes. We're in Knellipes.
We have no infrastructure.
We close friendships and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can convey one idea to someone.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human race.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this case many years ago, why, rather than getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have entrepreneurs in the world, and they never will say publicly what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
You have to have a re-up in it.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work to one thing to do, we need to be created a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the local company, the local government doctor, who is sitting with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way to change life.
I tried this in vitileity, West Australia.
I did a Ph.D. to try and escape the rainy brackets where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, my first three clients, and I helped him. He was a fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and then he would come to the fishermen, and they would say, "You had the Maori help us?
I helped these five fishermen work together and sell this amazing tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per hour, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them? Can you help us?
I had 12 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk>" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- and so the government says, "Let me put it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in founding.
There's a new generation of companies that go to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's math professor before he was dealing with companies. Peter's printer said, "Take is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
is the Department of Comlightenment's death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, you don't know what the smartest man Christchurch is going to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get to one.
You have to give them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
What's the most cheery you have of today?
"Sit, loving people. You applaud them.
I want to say, well, entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- decayable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freonart species of preservation is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, and use them and can counteract them.
The technologies that are not there.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget.
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they would speculate what would happen in the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows at this speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to deal with the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd already go under the crap.
And they see the dirty technology that lives in New York City.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive cars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered discourse.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
and from the smallest to the biggest company, all have to be able to perform three things: that must be a grand product, must be a grand market market, and the financial accounting has to be huge.
What do you have to guess?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
That's not something that's happening.
This person was never born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iystiest companies in the world -- Carnegie Westinghouse, Edison Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been called one: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start giving them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The job of 16-year-old is to support the first two pages of Richard Bransons autobiography as often as the word "me" and how often the word "weaving."
Never "me" and 32 times "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, who has a small entrepreneur's background, sit in cafes and bars, and the people who are forced to do what someone for this gentleman did for this epitoy, who talks about this epito. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping corporate entrepreneurs to help them find the means and people, and we've found that the wonder of the public intelligence is that the culture and the economy of this community can be transformed, just by understanding the passion and energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a charity for communication -- asking engineers to communicate in communication.
I was scared.
Fear. Fear among these students with their large brains and their large books and their large, I don't like familiar words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was driving down to the case of a pighole and saw a door in a whole new world.
And just as I felt, when I was talking to students, I was amazed at the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this wonder of this wonder.
I think to open this door, it requires great communications.
We need great communications from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are addressing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-obgientist to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their wonder country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you some of the ways that you can make it, that we can see that science and technology that you're doing is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us right now.
It doesn't just tell us that their catadores are studying, but it's also telling us that their catots, the light-sensitive structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat oxidalosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you misrepresentable.
Now, arguments are a barrier to understanding your thoughts.
Sure, you could use your "lime" and you could use it in time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is a much more intuitive thing to us?
To make your mind understood, it's not the same as to put down their level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to tradeoffs.
Now, some things about this are: examples, stories and analogies, this is how you can pull us into your closet.
And when you present your work, you'll take the dots off.
Have you ever asked you why it's called "up point?"
What happens when someone goes to it? Another one is going to be stabbed, and those dots are your first audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it's also very much on the speaking work of our brains, and it's by simply being very serious.
This is an example of Genevieve Brown that's much more powerful. It shows you that the specific structure of the lapchiness is so stable that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy, awkward sentence where the audience can lose and act when it's lost, and prints images and graphics that also encourage our other senses, and thereby creates a deeper understanding of what it is that describes.
These are just a few attempts that can help us open up these door and see the wonders of the country that compares science and technology.
And because the engineers I taught, I taught myself to use the "Names in me" tightly, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
If you look at your science and you're listening to your ads and your ads, you're going to be very excited about the relevance, and so the audience says, what's important is, and multiply the whole thing that you have to do with your incredible work, and it's going to make incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really looking for it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a drug with a phone, you can film a crime in Syria.
You can start a message with a cell phone and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a piece of your cell phone and you can record it in a sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city at that time.
And you can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed up on the road.
We've arrived in the fall of 1989, and we've imagined that all of these people who have gone and demand change have had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. I've got a cell phone for a lot of them.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines are all information.
It's raw data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. embassy has set out a right line.
So this is a policy line called the Department of Homeland Security.
And the point is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service administrator in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who gets an email to whom?
Who is sending a text message to?
And if you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months from your phone company or your Internet carrier for at least two years.
And all over Europe, people have stood up and said, "We don't want it."
They said we don't want to have this plan of protection.
We want to keep self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone service and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want it."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people pouring out on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Fake fear rather than fear."
And some of them even said this could become a case of Stumum 2.0.
The Stasi was the Lumimpolizei in East Germany.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can all this information really store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I use it?
So I asked my phone company, the German Teletext company, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information that got laid over me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Just a smaller Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening there.
So I decided to put a legal court on it, because I wanted to have that information.
But the German Tele-com said no, no, we're not going to give you that information.
And it ended up with a comparison with them.
I'm going to pull back the envelope, which is what they're all asking me to send information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court decided that the introduction of the E.U. embassy was a misplord on German.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
Thirty-four30 pages of information.
I first saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start with this?
Because you can see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, well, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called a security system.
So together online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see me drive from Frankffurt with the train to get to the Cln, and how many calls I'm going to go.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me up, and we're talking a few times together.
And then a couple friends call me up and they call up to each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other whenever they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I first said, let's imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1982 had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have had known who was at the demonstration, and if Stasi knew who the leader was, that might have never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And it's not the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today national agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it in a long run.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age are not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an important value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you're talking about your foreman, just because companies and government places have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long yet.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: spiral-tolerant, fast-diving restaurants, Brakak space.
So the city map is coming together and thinking about changing the name of South Central so that it stands for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles as if that changes something about what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Tortical stores, rapid-diving restaurants, Brakkak.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Sy and the Drivebys.
The committees are that the Drive-thrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a preventable condition.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it was at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you can see the negative effects that the existing food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been assuming that skateboarding and selling like use trucks.
I see dialysis centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I had a little bit to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food hotcase in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's part of the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to be in charge."
And I decided to hold it in this way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started planting my food hotspot and fruit trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We are a kind of pre-meditric, put together by gardening from all the social strills and all the city, and it's completely free, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a pre-step, and said I had to remove my garden, the plaster was a huge order to make it.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
Give a narrative of how food crops grow in a piece of land that you're completely not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez did a story about it, and he spoke to the city bank, and with a member of Green Ground, and they signed a petition on Change.org. And with 900 signatures, we succeeded.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My townmate even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why not do they do that?
LA. In the United States, most of the Brachkall in the city has possession.
They have 67 kilometers of Brachak's room.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell shouldn't they find that OK?
You get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds from the crop.
If you have green beans in the value of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables at 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my cure, I tell people to grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of these preconceived reality created by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Tort work is my graffiti. I'm going to buy my art.
Just as a graffiti artist who is banging walls, I'm going to break lawn and park spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my names for this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground the ground can do if you use it as canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
They would wonder how children are affected by it.
and gardening is the most antic and poignious act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you get strawberries.
I remember this time that this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the ground for the road."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that only made me more empowered to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid they're wrong.
It's on the road.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
I put a garden in this homeless garden in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to buy the laster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it stored with her mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even though it was just for a moment.
Green grass has already planted about 20 gardens.
And to our to Vermlate programs, we got about 50 people and we did it, and these are all volunteers.
If children grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get anything from that, if they don't show up how food and body affects, they blind, whatever you're accused of.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are right on the path, who are seen for them, and they don't go anywhere.
The gardening is a chance to see where we can train these children to take care of their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could produce the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire apartment on gardening places where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship carts and turn them into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free because free, because free is not sustainable.
The point about sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets and letting them experience the pride and the honor when you open up your own food, and when you open up farmers' markets.
So what I'm going to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all ecological rebels, gangster, gangster-hoo-hoo-hers.
We have to turn the picture of ganglight.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You're going to be feeling a little bit more like a butter, right?
And let's have the weapon to be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit in the boxy chairs and want to make a meeting where you talk about doing some jokes.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, you know, in my backyard, so we can plant any shit.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words about the whole Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And it's "nnnnnnnnnjoster" means "a-articulate politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper host gave a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who plays an office, independent of party, program or command, and his success is achieved by the pure power of validation."
I have no idea what exercises are.
Something with words, I think.
But it's really important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
So 1771, for example, according to the British parliament, newspapers were not going to be the exact word "written" of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name, Brass Crosby, who went on with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they threw it in, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to counter, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we'll find the first confession for the sentence "so strong like Brass." Many people think.
It's hard for the word of the pouch.
But that's not true. It's going back to a defendance of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it's just reached independence.
And you would see the question of, what you should call George Washington, the head of state.
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
And it's been misused in Congress for an infinite amount.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions that there were possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high-valness of George Washington, and again, other people's freedom of freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's not that nuanced.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought that was a good thing to do.
They weren't monarchistist, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was slightly bored, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the diary of the day, and it's written all the time: "I'm still going to have the same issue."
The reason for the deflection, and the boredness was that this was the House of Representatives against the Senate.
The Kansas House didn't want Washington to be a gooder. They didn't want to.
King, and maybe even give it to ideas about his success.
They wanted to give him the most humest, gourned, shearsty title, which they could think of.
This title was "Pountor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before, but he just meant that someone was listening to a gathering.
like a jury's precaution.
He had no longer had any size than the term "written," or "tit-mit-goo."
Sometimes there were little presidential candidates and they had small chiefs and government groups, but it was really a unobtrusive title.
And so the Senate refused to give it off.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to sign and meet foreign guardes.
Who will take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like the president of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you would not have the word to use the word "the Primeity," but they were totally saying that they were not supposed to be honest with their honorful respect for the opinions and practices, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's in the office of the state of Honest respectful -- not to the president of the United States and the other people who are not devoid on the United States.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First, I think it's the best I can -- I can't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the final president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, was just awarding the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- you wait 223 years later.
And thirdly, and that's really important, and that's the most important thing, is that the title of the United States of America today is not so humbling, right?
This has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drone and all that stuff.
True story and history has given the title size.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the emaard of self-hood -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house won, because nobody feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality of the words is much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 rebellion at the battle of Mr. Naalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I used my black Converse Bloves to a pair of brown leather moons and fired a rocket towards the government agent I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had grown up with the war, but next to Pyjama parties and football games and committing them with racist South America and non-distian demonstrations that no one had to travel with communism and Afghanistan and travel for Afghanistan, and I knew what I knew was.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm a man-in-own, I'm a man-own, Southern, South-stov, by God Gnnerr, and an incredibly political artist who's been working and created for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So there are lots of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rainbows. I want to make art that draws people into it and confers and references reality and actually using some kind of a kind of powerful population to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the one that's defensating his jihadist as "Popblood" and using armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihad god than to run for the parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Tell me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to allow these Maffiosi to spend as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, with a project called "Rape," where you're giving yourself a cop to build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, giving them money and giving them money to the names of Kabul police in them, and I hope that they will hope that they would take us 100 dollars from Afghanistan.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, the Intercational conflict.
The war and the other outsights that came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I would combine with a local government-friendly and multiple handbags in a fashion-friendly, super-friendly, super-green design process.
And I would like to see what a simple poker from Kabul looks like by Kiplings Perell, to create a dialogue about the current developmental institutions of the past colonial rhetoric about "The White Beem" in order to protect the brown man in front of himself and maybe even a little bit of a civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, you can be misleading, misinterested.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel like I've been building an uncomfortable tension here in this room, because I shouldn't have been attached to this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit to turn on this.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happiness of seeing this, I think.
If some women were really cheating when I came out, you don't need to say this to me now, I'll read this later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
It has no chance to do that.
These elevations are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull out the sweater over my head, because then you're going to wake me off, so you're not doing anything while it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it wasn't that uncomfortable, I hope, like this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I've just completely changed your mind in six seconds.
And this image -- I had never really a friend of mine in fact.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I should use my back and fit with my hand to the hair of this guy.
And apart from the surgery or the wrong things that I took to work two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and the way we look at it -- even though it's super-simplifious -- is a huge impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable is to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
So I'm going to try to answer the questions that people are always asking me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason, as I became a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical in the midst of admiration, but we are biologically programmed, but also as big, fat, feminist and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that was handed out for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion lawyers like, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor at NYU counted all the modules on the run, each of which was consumed, and that 677 segments were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that I've been asked is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown up?"
And I say to them, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become the president of the United States, or the creator of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
If they still say that great counter to this amazing counter, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Am my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of the American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like you want to get the Jackossto in the lottery.
You can't do it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of using models of technology, because unlike heart surgery, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we want to run a picture," now the leg goes first, it goes long, and long, this arm goes back, it's on the back, it's in the head, it's three-quarters, and you just move back, and you can see that way back, 300 times, 400 minutes, you're going to
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less awkward than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish the school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say much. If you say you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to say, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Am there any photos going on?"
And yes, pretty much all of these photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photograph I took, and this was also the very first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my period.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
This is how I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this clip.
My girlfriend had to come and join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a couple days before a Shooting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They are constructors, and they are constructing a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeupists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the evaluation and the operation. They're programming. That's not me.
Okay, next of all, people always ask me, "You wared? Do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-inch sneakers that I can never wear, except, but the things that I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course, we were stopped. It took one: "Excuse me, Mr. Winner, and we could go on.
I've had these costless things because of my appearance and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and rigged last year, 85 percent of black and Latino, and most of the young men.
It lives in New York only 177,000 young black and Latino, for which not the question, "Am I stopped?"
But, "How often am I going to cut? When I'm stopped?"
And in my research to this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The final question I have to ask myself is, "How is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thin and shiny hair, you feel very happy and so brave."
And backstage gives you an answer that might be very much more than this.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
Everything is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never tell before the camera, which I never said before before, is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had skinny legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most tricky hair and the coolest tomatogers, and they are because of their appearance, probably, uncertain women on the planet.
When I prepared this talk, it seemed really hard to get a more honest balance, and I felt very uncomfortable with it, and I said, "I got all the benefits from a pile that got confused in my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to add to, "And it's not always going to make me happy."
It was very difficult to unite a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I find it great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years since my career has passed off, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't be saying I wasn't going to be paying for college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of image in our misreadable and misfortune.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, gaddafafi resistance. Give him a bow.
But never will I ever be a Gaddafi revolution.
Now, it's been around for almost two years since the Libby-discovered revolution, inspired by the waves of mass-through the real estate and the Egyptian revolution.
I would join many other Libyans, in and out of the way, to ask Libyens, to ask a day of anger, and to start a revolution against the tyrannonic regime of Gadaffis.
And she was there, a big revolution.
Boy, a Lebanby woman and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice stopped.
They have demonstrated some informants by being put up against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a very strong sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west, to the South.
Finally, after six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and overrovert the tyrants.
Gaddafi left a great criminal, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed the tyrant regime, both infrastructure and the cultural and moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I realized how many other women are going to rebuild the civil society of Lybias, and we asked a rebel and legitimate transition to democracy and national decalion.
Nearly 200 organizations, and right after the case, Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of capacity, human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peace collection of Libyes, a movement of women, leaders of different life, their goal is to enter public liberality for women, and to be right for the right to vote for democracy and peace creation.
I met a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, a more polarized environment, a environment that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a initiative to the peace collection of Libyian women to get to a jurisdated election, a law that anyone, any citizen, no matter what the background, should be the right to vote and to charge, and most of all, to a political sector between male and female, on the vertical, vertical and horizontal level, to make a complete and a complete decision to make a difference.
And in the end, our initiative has been taken and successfully.
Women won 17,5 percent of the nationwide prison in the first elections for 52 years.
But it made it very, very safely, the history of elections and the whole revolution after the whole revolution -- because every day we stopped new news about violence.
We woke up a morning to the lead of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
And then, again, another morning, the murdering of police were signed by the Army.
And really, every day, we were condemning the tyranny and their ongoing impact on human rights in prison and their defenses of laws and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had initially stopped.
Intitude, perseverment and revenge became the ion of the Fol tour of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our reins and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, have made the wrong choices and the wrong choices.
We've misleaked our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security to Lybia.
Did the urge to do the difference and the shift between female and male candidates and national references?
No, it didn't have it.
What is it?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate and dominating selfish politics of dominance and disenbowing, both men and women?
Perhaps women weren't the only thing that missed it, but the female value of compassion, the gittle and the dish.
Our society needs a national dialogue and convergence when it took the elections, which has only strengthened polarization and disinpletion.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes to the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop in the name of anger and demand one day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that is not just validating the values, but also to misuse: cold, not revenge, cooperation, not competition, not a lack of it.
These are the ideals that need one of the rapty lybias to keep peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemia, it's about the overheating of feminine and masking perspective.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do this in existential ways before we do it sociopolitically.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," "I'm the word of the Good God, rainy."
The word "raheem," again, which is known in all of the abraamous traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "raag," "in mother the mother" and symbolically symbolizes the mother of the whole humanity, which is the man-in-law, and the female, and the tribes of all peoples and all over.
And just like the mother's assaulting the embryo that grows in him, it's perfectly suited to the basic disincentment of compassion that's all of its existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is going to include all things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade did not have a preview before my Groll."
Do we all want to be the gi of the gistle.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "nonry" for a cold.
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Illung, but we didn't learn much about the world out there, except America, South Korea and Japan are enemies.
Although I often wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole changing time.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public dissection, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer from myself.
But in 1995, my mom brought a letter from my sister's sister of a colleague.
In it, "If you were to bet this, our five family members will not be in this world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
I just went off the train station and saw something terrible I can't delete from my memory.
There was a bleeding woman on the ground, and a pulged kid in her arm was lit helplessly in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all concerned about caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-10s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were eaten to the victims, and many others have only survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree synapses.
Officity has been more and more likely to get worse, so at night, everything was just about me, except the lights of China on the other side of the popular record that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of amroc, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
And you can see, the river is very illuminating, and it enables North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it would take me 14 years to revive again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like North Carolina refugees, but I soon learned it's not just incredibly difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Carolina are considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly off, and you would send me back to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be the North Koreans, so they tested my Chinese faces and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid I would have been thinking about explode my heart.
If anything unnatural could appear, I could be locked up and signed.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the question, a senior officer said to others, "That was a misplugry.
She's not a Northstore.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China in foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught and signed by the Chinese police.
These girls were having great luck.
Even though they were caught, they eventually released out of this immense international pressure.
These North Koreans did not have much luck.
Every year, there are numerous North Koreans in China, and they are being rejected to North Korea, where they were tortured, locked or publicly equipped.
Although I was lucky enough to escape, there are many other North Koreans who are not going to go.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
And they've learned a new language, and they've found their work, and their world can be replicated in a moment.
And after 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was blown down in South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent because of 67 years of the division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Koreans?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life did not fall easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording test for the university.
Just as I was accustomed to my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx authorities started to remove the money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to take an incredible route back to the freedom they're going to get.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironry, I took a flight back to China, and I went to the North Korean border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, to more than 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
and he took the out of all of them and started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed to him that they were a cheer, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to make it to the laze border, but I had to almost all of my money to register the border control of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border resolution.
After I had paid money sentence and bribing, my family was released in a month, but shortly, my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of my life's biggest dislapse.
I'd done everything I could to avoid my family to liberty, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Union's message.
And I went and forth between the immigration department and the police department, and I was trying to desperately liberate my family, but I had not enough money to pay for bribes or money launderers.
I lost all my hope.
And that made me feel like, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that there was a stranger to care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without refusing it to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get it out of jail.
And I thank him about my heart and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Carolina people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The stranger who's ever described me symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back together in South Korea, but it's only a step to the public.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get to a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea to change from within.
I had such a lucky fortune to get as much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make hope to succeed North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have just one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and it's very, very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them unconditionally, and he disliked them.
It's not greedy. It's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to remember the one I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely impossible memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate cheer, but he remembers the paper year of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the very first episode of the tecubbies on my arm was given to Lady and Gagagas's birthday.
Don't they listen to me?
But a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged me and strengthened my soul was that although this was the case, even though they were not considered common, that only one could mean is that they were exceptional -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "Autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that influences social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's very different in each individual, and that's why Remi is so different from Sam.
And the world is found every 20 minutes in a new person with autism, and while it's one of the fastest growing development disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've encountered autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came down.
And as he got older, he became different and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustiness and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any biases, a human who never had otherwise been lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wished they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Continality is the beauty that makes us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's a different kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You're allowed to be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it, and all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victim of potential.
The opportunity to be at scale, progress and change, is where we try to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton had filled us with awe and curiosity, with a project that took a little bit of an apple and then through a degeneration time of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femtoto Shot, a new reconstruction technology that's so fast that it can create slow-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look out of our viewpoint, or can't stare at corners in our bodies without an <unk>-ray in our bodies and really ask the question of what we mean with "Camera"
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it in a billionth of a second -- these are multiple Femtoseconds -- I create a package of photons that hardly is a millimeter, and this photon pack, this project, will move to light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this project, you take this photons package and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion time?
So this whole event, this.
So, think about this, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- that's how long it takes to go back this track -- but I'm going to try to highlight this video by the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot happens, so let me go through this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, starts in the bottle with a photon pack that starts moving through, and that eventually breaks inside.
Part of the light is flowing out to the table, and you see the spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the trigger of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of a snow that's suspended in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on a few images at the end.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back the same route and slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
Day, day a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a still-time photographer?
You can see again how those waves are streaming down the table, the Tomate and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature was drawing a photo like this, each of which is a Femto image, but of course, our eye is a partial image.
But if you look at this Tomlin again, you'll see that if the light is sliding over the Tom Rover, it's going to keep it in the dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomlin is turned on and the light goes in and comes back after a few hundredth of a second.
So, in the future, if this Femto camera is installed in your camera in your camera, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is closed, without touching it at all.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you took a picture of a short air time, you have very little light, but we fixed a billion times faster than your short-lived period of air, so you're not getting as good as light at all.
So here's what we're doing. We're sending this projectill, this photon pack, millions and millions and more time, and we're drawing this with very clever synchrony, and we're putting these gigabytes of data together to make this Femto video that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: Can we see corners?
The idea is that we're lighting a little light on the door.
It's going to be deflated, go into the space, it's going to be reflected back on the door, and then finally it's going to be able to use these more magnifix trajectories of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto truck.
Behind the wall is a puppet, and we're going to let the light go down on the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications, it was released from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to peel this light project, and they're going to push it on this wall, and this photon package is going to be poured back into all directions, and some of the photons will get our hidden soup, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny percentage of the photons will come back to the camera, and it's going to be very, very, very interesting at the time, very different.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto truck has some unique skills.
It has a very good time re-consuming, and it can look at the world at light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by taking a laser and putting it on a laser, we can take a raw image that looks like you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take a lot of these pictures, we put it together, we try to analyze the different light textures, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit to do with it before we can make this happen from the lab, we could build cars that are out of collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous liver injuries by looking at light, looking through the open window, or we can build endosak on the body deep around Ok Wolcard and also see Kakakakakak.
But because of the blood and tissue, that's of course a very challenging thing, which is why this is really a term for scientists to think about Femto's photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-pressure photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we're collecting every single time, we can create not just a new form of computer photography, with color and color capture, and just looking at the waves between each time, and we can not forget about that wave between time.
But it's also something fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottleneck, you can see the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
And it turned out that we're almost at the speed of light, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture.
The sequence, in events in the world, appear in the camera in reverse order, so you're using the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So, whether it's to focus on photography around corners or to create a new imaging tool for medicine or new forms of art, since we've been able to open all the data and details on our website and hope that the trusters, the creative and the research community, we should stop showing us to start to start on the megapixs, the next-dimensional, the next-dimensional, the digital data, the next-dimensional slides.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that a lot of educational deliberations don't go through, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the past few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and scons and chalk.
The projects were created from my questions, how much rented my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories from the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the free-loised homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the huge oak that has been hazzled for hundreds of years, drunk and juniper shadow. I'm familiar with a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never stops, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with the most left-off-offed number of feet in America.
I live near this house thinking about how I can confuse it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I've felt a lot of gratitude for my life, and it's gotten me to be clear about the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose and forget about what's really important in life.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a side of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote with a treasure of the blankets: "If I die, I want to die ..." Everyone can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it kept growing.
I want to share some sentences that are written on the wall with people.
I want to be sued for piracy in the first time."
I want to die before I ever, I want to be on the International Pass line.
I want to die if I want to sing for millions of people."
I want to die if I want to plant a tree."
I want to die before I ever, I want to live "weaving" on the road.
"I want to die before I ever, I want to keep it in my arms again."
I want to be somebody called a Kavallery in the first time."
I want to die before I ever, I want to be myself all."
This neglected place became a sensual place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for exploration and thinking, and thinking about what's most important as we grow and change.
I did this last year and got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a kit in the world, and now in countries like Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public places if we have the opportunity to raise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view, and to think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I have realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthens us.
And the idea of death is that it really captures us life.
Our common spaces show what's important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in targeted mathematics. I'm a special problem for anyone who's engaged in a more motivated mathematics, is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody really knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
Sm dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are delighted with the sight of the racist ballet and the waving, as you'll see.
So, to the ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it to my fellow people's founations, who at his time was a ballet-paction.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
But still, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this illness, and they have to live with the indulable symptoms like weakness, tremor, and other things that cause this illness, and so we need an objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know if there's a cure, if we have an objective metric to answer this question.
Now, in trouble, for Parkinson's disease and other movements, there's no biomarker, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside of clinical trials, it's never ever done.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would save a failed tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a very expensive hospital service.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to go into the neurological section.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all at least in a certain sense virtual uselessness like my Sudanese Abplitude.
And you can see a video of the vibrating vocal tone.
This happens in a healthy state when someone is creating speech sounds, we can look at us as a coherent ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs if we created sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And like Ballet, it requires an enormous practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And what you can do is we can tell the position of vibrating mood bells, and just like the limbs are affected by the vocal muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see the example of irregular vocal sounds on the bottom.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Difficult, weakness, eifess.
The language will even become more and more wiser and more colorful, and that's an example of theymptom.
The impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision software combined with new machine-based learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone's in a room between disease and health, just because of the sounds of the vocal.
How can these tests be used to the clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
It's not that much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of these are accurate. They're not being conducted by experts who are wrong.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a great order.
And we can do these amazing goals.
We can reduce logistics difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data through conventional observation.
We can do low-cost increases in clinical trials and have the first study of the whole population to be viable.
We have the opportunity to go for the first time to look for biomarkers to the disease before it's too late.
Now we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start Parkinson's voice-recipite.
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough output data to get the results done.
We have Rufn numbers that are freely accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with or without Parkinson's, can call cheaply, send pictures for a few cents. I'm known to be blessed to have six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell if the patient has to suffer Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them will not be done to the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are designed to use them to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is there?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such a fantastic job -- has shown that it's also working on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
So people can call them the phone, they can call the test, they can call it. People could call it with Parkinson's disease, they can take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya on the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back of the back, you see the cows of my father, and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Boston National Park is just in the South, so it means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was a terrible one. It was our only can.
My tribe, the tribe of the Maasa, thinks we've come together with our animals and our farms of the sky, which is why our animals mean so much.
I was learning to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our mother. They're also on this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are just so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible for his father's cows for six and nine years. That's what it was for me.
I had to figure out a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's drawing.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird search and you go again. The next time, but the next time you come and you say, this thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the stall. I walked around with a torch around him, and this time the lions didn't interrupt.
lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
Even as a young boy, I worked all day in my room, and I even took the new radio of my mom, and the day, she took me almost a lot of work, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy-and-driving call out of a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn the right or the left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and turn off.
This is a little pearl lamp from a broken flaphlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is actually putting the battery, which is carrying the battery, which is the power to the correct plant, and I call it a transformator.
And the right to the right is to stink.
You can see that the pearls are pointing out, because from there, the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions believe I'm going around the rubble, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this at home, and since then we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including birds, like hyena, or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants out of the way.
My invention helped me to go to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps to supply and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's no other, and I'm showing people how to use it.
I was just one year ago, and he was just a boy from the savanna who was coughing his father, and I saw airplanes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a seat!"
And I'm standing here now.
I was invited to draw a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to hated lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and the lions, we can do it together, side by side with lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm very much.
You don't even know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical innovations.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I work on an electrical fence. A pourage of electrozception?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've stopped the trial because I got a blow.
First of all, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to be feeding you every step of your game, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, and I've got to share my passion with you today, and I've done one of my 15 slides on it, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no chance to shoot one more picture. Not even the lighting was being explored.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I would hold my daughter to my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
And this is exactly a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this goes out ...
When my daughter's third birthday came to speak, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father-in-law turn to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking, you know, go past fishing tours, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is, if you're going to have a completely stranger and you're going to have a camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody has ever been touched with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these trips would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11 after the 11th, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a coincidence moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October for a week, and how we change our time and how we change year by year, not only physically but in all, to reflect.
Because whenever we make the same picture, our perspective of time changes, as it's reached, it's always reaching new milestone, I can see life with its eyes, how it's dealing with everything, and how it sees.
This very, very intense time we spend on each other is something that we value and expect for every year.
Last day, while one of our trips, we went for a walk, and all of a sudden, it was as if it was fixed, it shows a red mark on a slipple, which they had learned as a little kid, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she had thought of as a five-year-old at this point.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store for the first nine years ago.
And now she's looking in New York for high schools, because she's really trying to study in New York.
And I realized, obviously, the most important thing that we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious capacity of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not really on a long time photo of a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you to come up with this image today and you don't want to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
