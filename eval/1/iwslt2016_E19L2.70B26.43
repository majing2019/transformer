When I was 11 years old, I was woken one morning by the sounds of the thumb.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show from the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was once in the day, because the news was largely depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
So I was complaining for five years as a boy, and my older sister, who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school both of us.
Every day, we took a different path so nobody could guess where we were going.
We hid our books in shopping bags so we'd look like we'd just go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a pity in the winter, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And every time, the class suddenly had to come out for a week because the Taliban had been listening to smallpox.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they advising us?
Did you know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I had a great fortune to grow up in a family where education was important and it was valued by daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign minister of a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to send to school and be rejected by his father.
But my mother became a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to retire only to transform our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- watching here -- was the first person in his family ever to get to a school.
For him, it was always clear that his children would get an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it a much bigger risk of sending his children to school.
I still know that in the years under the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, about the constantly fear and the perspective of the Earth.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Toy, please listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen from your money. You can be distributed from your home in war.
But one thing that will remain with you is, what's inside of this, and even if we have to pay our blood supply to your school fees, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree as a graduation, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly exclusive of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family because he was complaining about sending his daughters to school, one of the first ones to the challenge me.
He doesn't just push out with my college degree, but also to say that I was the first woman to be who drove him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have a big dreams, but my family has even more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped build SOLA, the first and perhaps even the only Internet for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school girls still are risky.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to see opportunities.
And watching their parents and fathers stand for them, as my parents then did, despite me, and against all odds.
So Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home of SOLA in her village, and they were out of death through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he got to his home, the phone rings, and a voice punished him if he left his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "I'm going to kill you now, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game because of your old-fashioned and over-reasing imagination."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that is often deported by the West: that behind most of us, the success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that is aware that their success is also success.
Now, that's not to say that our mothers are not going to play a vital role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are both centered and they're convincing for a very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
The Taliban just went to school a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be from America, so different.
Americans recognize how unsafe these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not over time and the end of the U.S. troops are changing.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I look at the students in my school, and their parents who are helping them to help them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities, and every day, the girls remember the CDLA.
Just like I have, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including a profession, has been coined by my life by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the projects of technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we were Italian, that we were good people, and we were so talented in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples at Zambezi," was one where we used to show people of the Sambia as food has grown.
We came to Italian forest in Southeast, in this shiny valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population to grow Italian tomatoes and to Bechini.
Of course, the local workers had no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they were not training anything, we said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Wait time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, it all felt wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatoatoes. In Italy they got so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Hebamb, "Look, just how agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red, over night, about 200 nilbs came out of the river and measured everything.
We said to the Toramb: "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why haven't you told us that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so brave in Italy, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French countries did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the mortal.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we've never given to the unrested African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the leaders of the African continent a 1.5 trillion euros in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was doing.
Just read their book.
Check out about a African woman, what we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I suffer each other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisung: I suffer each other's culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called the "bwana," the boss.
I was loved when I read the book "Small," of Schready's, and he said, most importantly in economic development, if people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that wasn't neocolatic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react to people and to create a system called corporateization, where nobody will ever be initiated, but you will never be motivated to the service of the local passion, the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get to a community of ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet ourselves in cafeteria.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're closing up friends and finding out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone an idea.
If that person doesn't like that, what do you do?
The passion for your growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing for humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person who has the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this trap: Why not in a community, not getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never have in their own, and they never will say in public what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
You have this blink of vision.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We work to one thing to do, we need to create social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
There's got to be a new profession that needs to be created.
This is the company's village doctor, the local department of the company, who's sitting with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way of transforming life.
I tried this in seperance, West Australia,
I was a professional at the time, trying to escape the disengage, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and within three days, my first customers, and I helped him fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and then he got to the fishermen, and they said, "You brought the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together, and I was able to sell this amazing tuna not to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million dollars, but to Japan for Sushi, for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us?" Can you help us?
I had 12 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm listening to the mouth, and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Do you want it again."
We did it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies who are walking towards loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best companies in the history, died at 96 years ago.
Peter's printers was a philosophy professor before he was working with companies. Peter's printer said, "Canning is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Reject is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you.
You have to give them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come to be enough.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For what presentation you most applauded tomorrow?
"Sear, passionate people. You were applauding them.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the irreversible fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freonart of Environment is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, manage, transport them, and then we can correspond to them.
The technologies that don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic journal many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in 1860s.
In 1860 they came together and they would speculate what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grew on this pace, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd gone under the crap.
In 1860 they see the dirty technology that's eating lives from New York City.
What happens? Forty years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
Of the smallest, all of them have to be able to perform three things: to sell new product, to be grand-comprietary, to be grand market market market, and to be a financial justice worker.
So guess what?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iystiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that's been called all successful companies in the world, one thing that's only one: no one person was founded.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in Northeast entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them how to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography. The job of 16-year-olds is to support two sides of Richard Bransons National Geographic's autobiography as often used the word "we" and how often the word "we."
Never again, 32 times we are.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody founded it.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small corporate background in cafeteria and bars, and your dedicated buddy, who are going to do for them, what someone who did for this gentleman who talks about this epitpos. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate facilitators to help them find the means of the middle and the people, and we have found that the wonders of intelligence in the local population are going to change the culture and the economy of that community, just by understanding the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I learned how it must be, I think, Alice must be in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a charity for communication -- asking engineers to divide communication.
I was scared.
Really right. Fear of these students with their large brains and their large books and their large books, not my familiar words.
But when the conversation evolved, it took me like Alice, when she got down to the can of a pighole and saw a door in a whole new world.
And just as I felt, when I was talking to the students, I was amazed at the thoughts they had, and I wanted others to discover this wonder of this wonder.
I think to open up those towers, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are addressing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go anywhere. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-dististist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers are not going to invite us to their wonderland.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, well, what?
It's just why our scientific territory is so relevant to us.
It's not just that our grandchildren are studying, but it's also telling us that their stomachs, the material structure in our bones, are examining, because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And if you describe what you're doing, then you're using useless arguments.
Now, arguments are a sign of understanding your thoughts.
Sure, you could use your "F" and you could use it in time and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is far more intuitive for us?
To understand our minds is not the same as they were throwing down their level.
As Einstein said, "Forget things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to tradeoffs.
Some of the things that we've got to do is to consider examples, examples, stories and analogies, and in this way you can pull us into your boss.
And when you present your work, the net points will take away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "reverse"?
What happens when someone gets to the head? Another one is taken to the first, and the first of those dots, the first people in your audience.
A slide like this, not only boring, but also very much on the discussion work of our brain, and we're getting very excited about it.
This is a sample of Genevieve Brown, which is much more powerful. It shows you that the specific structure of the worm is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, unreadable sentence where the audience can take care of the thread, and use images and graphics that also encourage our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it's describing.
These are just a few of the ways that can help us open up these towers and see the wonders of the country that are involved in science and technology.
Since the engineers I've been teaching, I've been teaching to make contact with the <unk>the hotel in me" in a tight, I want to sum up all the things with an equation.
And if you look at your science and you're talking about your ads, you'll be able to share them through the relevance, which is the audience, which is important, and multiply the whole thing with your incredible work, and it's making possible ways of making things that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was mainly drawn to it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can film a crime in humankind in Syria.
You can tweet a cell phone and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it on the sound cloud, you can get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin in year 1984, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this town.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed up for change.
We are in the fall of 1989 and we imagine that all of these people who came out and asked change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone in it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Every single cell phone today.
But today, my cell phone wants to talk about and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines are full of information.
It's raw data.
And why are the information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.S. embassy issued a policy line.
This is called the policy line for the supply of the law enforcement.
And the key is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service administrator in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And all across Europe, people have stood up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this protection system.
We want to have self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, there were priests, all of whom said, "We don't want to do that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people streaming down the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freeching out of fear."
And some even said this could become the toumum 2.0.
The stasis was the Lumobolizei in East Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really working?
Can the real information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using it?
So I asked my phone company, the German Tele-com, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information that saved you over me.
And I once asked her, and I asked her again, and I couldn't get a real answer. Just a little bit more blue bla.
But then I told myself, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been spreading your origins.
So I decided to put a legal trial on it, because I wanted to have that information.
But the German Tele-Dap said no, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end of it, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to pull back the envelope, which is what they're sending me all the information.
Because in the meantime's federal court, the introduction of E.U. Senate was violating German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
I saw it first, and I said to myself, well, it's a giant file. My home.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what am I going to start with?
Because you can see where I'm, where I'm sleeping at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called the protection control of the law enforcement.
So with time and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom out, you can browse.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see how I'm going to drive from Frankfurt with the train to get to the oil, and how many calls I'm going to go.
And all of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me up, and we're talking together a few times.
And then a few friends shouting up and they call up to each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where times they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to who to talk to who to email, all of which can be done if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months, in Europe, up to two years.
As I first said, let's imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in the streets of 1982 had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the statue had known who the leader was, maybe it would never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then after that, the fall of the iron of the curtain.
Because today, the government agencies and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the chance to track our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age are not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to struggle every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an issue of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're talking about your congressor, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they saved over you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to struggle for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: juninal toilets, rapid-dist restaurants, Brakak spaces.
So the town map is coming together and thinking about changing the name of South Central so that it represents for something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles as if something changes to it, which is wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Tultical stores, rapid-riving restaurants, Brakak space.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-thrus and the Drivebys.
The committees are that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a preventable condition.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 miles away.
I couldn't do that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of your house, you can see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I dream that skatingers bought and sold like use of use in the outfit.
I see dialogy surfing like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really like it for 45 minutes, to get an apple that's not mediated by pesticides.
So I planted a food rake in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park plant.
It's 45 to three meters.
The thing is, it's part of the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay there."
And I decided to hold it in this way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Grates, and together we started planting my food hot and fruit trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We're kind of a pre-meditformance group, put together by gardening all the social strills and all over the city, and it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The town came up to me, and he basically handed me a planner, and said I had to remove my garden, the waiting charge was a huge order to do it.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
Give a narrative on how to grow food in a piece of land that you're totally not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time it wouldn't end.
L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he talked to the city Council, and a member of Green Ground, and they signed a petition on Change.org, and we succeeded with 900 signatures.
We stopped the victory.
In fact, my townmate called it and said they support it and love what we do.
So, why not do they do that?
L.A. In the United States, most of the palms in the property of the city are owned.
They own 67 miles of Brakall.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should they not find that OK?
because you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds from the crop.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my He's proprietary, I tell people they should grow their own food.
To grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this pre-made reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Gardencraft is my graffiti. I'm planting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who is sniffing the walls, I'm going to break lawns and parking lots.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my closest to this stuff.
You would be surprised by what the ground floor can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden being an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how children are affected by it.
Sarding is the most arduous and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And then you get strawberries.
I remember that time that mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked at them like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you didn't have to do that.
The garden is not the road for reason."
I was ashamed of seeing people who were so close to me and hungry, and that only empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid they were laughing.
It's on the road.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
I put a garden in this homeless home in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to get out of the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it affected them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it was just a moment.
Green grassblues have planted about 20 gardens.
And we got there in our orbit, and we got 50 people and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
If kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get anything from it, if they don't show them how food and body affects, they will blind, whatever you're doing to them.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path, who are as vulnerable to them, and they won't go anywhere else.
The gardening is a chance, where we can train these kids to care for their communities to live in sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could produce the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take ship transcripts and turn them into healthy cafeteria.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free fakes, because free is unsustainable.
The myth of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets and experiencing the joy, the pride and the honor, when you open your own food and you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all ecological rebels, gangster, gangster-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hers.
We need to turn the image of weather.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to see the gangster, right?
And let the weapon be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit down in the cuffy chairs and want to make a meeting where you talk about it,
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, in my garden so that we can plant some blunt.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford is "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
Andnnollygoster means "a-articulate politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher approved a better definition: "A Snollygoster is someone who's commuted a post, independent of side, program or command, and his success by the pure force of validative irrationality."
I have no idea what to do.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
So for example, 1771, according to the British Parliament, the newspapers were not equipped with the exact word "winning" of the debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who came back with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it a little bit of courage, but he was brave enough to rebel, and he ended up going to have so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first evidence for the sentence "so" is strong, like Brass." Many people think.
Brass, on the English word for the wheel,
But that's not true. It's about a defendance of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time it's reached independence.
And you would see the question of, what would you call George Washington, the head of state,
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
And it was discussed for an end of the Congress for an infinite amount of time.
And there were all kinds of things you could do.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high Christianity of George Washington, and again, others, the legislators of freedom of people in the United States of Washington.
Not so much of a distortion.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought it was safe.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored with this, because this debate was three weeks.
I read the journal of a senator who was constantly writing, "Wait the same topic."
The reason for the waving, and the boredness was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be aptant. They didn't want to.
King, and maybe even to give him ideas about his success.
They wanted to give him the most humorous, ominous titles, which they thought they could.
This title was "Pountor."
President didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that someone had a gathering.
Something like a pre-driving jury.
He didn't have the size anymore than the record "written" or "talk water."
Sometimes there were little Presidents of small chiefs and civil society groups, but it was really an unobtrusive title.
That's why the Senate refused him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him the President.
This guy has to sign the ban and hit foreign interrogators.
Who will take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like the president of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, we're not going to be able to use the term "the congressional," but they were totally oblivious that they were not satisfied because of their honest respect for the opinions and practices of civilized nations, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's palegivistic that the office of state-state-s interests -- that they were not devoided by the people in the United States.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First, and I think that's the best I can do -- until now, I can't figure out if the Senate ever validated the president.
Barack Barack Obama, who just borrowed the title. He just waits for the Senate to become active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary is -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important thing, is that the theme of the United States of America today is not so humbling, right?
This has to do something more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title of size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
You'll get a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the emaard of self-destruction, well, it was.
But you know how many nations there are to a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative house, because no one feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away from, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a board with about 50 rebellion at the combat of Mralalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would sit with my black Converse seminal gloves against a pair of brown leatherdandals, and I would have a rocket in the head of the government, which I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had been hit by war, but next to Pyjama parties and football plays and commotion with racist South countries and non-distian protests who never had a "dored" with communism and lived for Afghanistan, and destroy the stories before I knew what I knew.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm here, I'm a committed As Liberia, Southern London, the island of God Gnaden, an atheist, and a radical political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and created.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainbows. I want to make art that draws people into it and confers authorities and re-explicates reality and even using a kind of a sophisticated set of people to try to understand the world in which we live.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the guy who's fighting jihad against the activists like "Popstar Bling" and used militant religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can do to the jihad first, when it's for Parliament to run for and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Pear me! I'm doing jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi who are spending on their own as a national hero.
I want to go to the bottom of corruption in Afghanistan with a project called "Rapeing," where you're going to be a cop, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and drive cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, giving them money and giving them money and in the names of Kabul, the police department gave them the hope that they hope to take the 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, in the Intercient conflict.
The war and the stranger who came to him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I combine local combat from indigenous Afghan parents with a shelter or several handbags into a re-friendly, super-greened,
And I'd like to see what a simple poker from Kabul is between Suiplings Appell in 1899 to create a dialogue about the current developmental institutions that have in their past colonial rhetoric about "The White Beem" to protect themselves and to defend them a little bit.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, you can misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly this.
I feel like I've built a uncomfortable tension here in the room now, because I shouldn't have been attracted to this dress.
Fortunately, I'm going to have something to change with it.
This is the first time someone pulls himself on the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happiness of seeing it.
If some women were really cheating when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read it back to Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged because I can change 10 seconds in a very short way, what you think of me.
Now, it doesn't have any chance to do that.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to move the sweater over my head, because then you'll all wave me down, so don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as embarrassing as this image, I hope.
A schematic is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I should use my back to use my back and attach my hand to the hair of this guy.
And beyond the surgery or the wrong trails that I had imagined two days ago for work, there's very few ways to change our utterances, and our utterances are -- even though it's superficial and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Being afraid is to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call that a sexy girl.
I'm going to try to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I was discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is this legacy?
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical in the image of the narrative, but we're biologically programmed, but also as big, courageous, feminist and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was handed out for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion-in-laws might call them, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Lioo.
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm afraid to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor at NYU, everyone was counted the modules on the run, each one that was consumed, and that 677 segments were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is this little girl, "Why?
Do you know what? You can do anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, who would be completely insane, because if you were the first one."
If they still say that great counter to this great counter, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American birdhood or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say later, you want to become a model, it's as if you want to say you want to win the Jackger in the lottery.
You can't do it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career route.
Now I want to show you 10 years of continuous model knowledge, because unlike cardiac surgery, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a photo going on, then the leg goes first, and long, that arm goes to the back, up to the front, up to three-quarters, you just move back, and you see that way back, you'll see 300 times, maybe 300 friends inception.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less weird than that in the middle.
I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you've done some workings, and you can't say much, because if you say you want to be president of the United States, but in life, 10 years of underwear, you'll see weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is saving all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are enriched, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photograph I took, and this was also the first time I carried a trachini. I didn't even have my period.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the book.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a mojama party a couple days before a Shooting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and makeupists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the pre-medits and the protocols. They're programming. This is not me.
Okay, so what do people always ask me? People always ask me, "You war for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-cent-touch shoes I can't wear except, but the things I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge one day, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she walked over a red light, and of course we were stopped, and of course it took you to say, "Excuse me, Mr. Wiger," and we could go on.
I got these costless things because of my appearance and there's not because of my personality and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and executed last year, and they were 85 percent black and Latino, and most of them young men.
It lives in New York, only 177,000 young, male and Latino, who don't ask for themselves the question, "Am I stopping?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I stopped?"
And in my research, I found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I have to say, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think you'll expect this answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and a little shiny hair, then you feel very happy and wonderful."
And backstage gives us a response that might be expressed as well.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only one half of the story, because what we never even tell from the camera before, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I'm feeling unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had little legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most bright hair and the most cool flakes, and they are because of their appearance, probably, uncertain women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable about going here and saying, "I got all the benefits from a pile that were being bent up to my power." And it doesn't feel very good to add to the point, "And that's not what makes me happy."
It was very difficult to unite a legacy of oppression because of gender and race, when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've done it here before 10 or 20 years ago, and my career has passed off, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or I wouldn't be telling you how I was going to get to go, or maybe I wasn't going to talk about how I paid college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misreadable successes and failure.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, Thaddafi resistance. Give him a bow.
But never will I, as any of you, will become a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been around almost two years since the Libyan revolution, inspired by the waves of mass incarceration both in the Tunisian and in the Egyptian Revolution.
I joined a lot of other Libyans, within and outside Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gadaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Lebanese women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice to the air.
They proved some sort of prehistoric courage by which they were put against the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east above the distant West, all the way to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and overtake the tyrants.
Gaddafi has left a huge criminal being, a legacy of tyranny, corruption, and the foundation of change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed tyrannical regimes both infrastructure and also the culture and the moral structure of the pink-bian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I renamed how many other women were able to rebuild civil society, Lybias. We asked a participatory and legitimate transition to democracy and national jurisdictions.
Near to 200 organizations, as soon as Gaddafis founded at Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the issues of performance, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Libyscher women, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to enter public society for the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to our right to the right-being of democracy and peacebuilding.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and impairment.
I led a initiative to the peacebuilding platform of Libyters of women to achieve a sovereign election law, a law that would offer every citizen, no matter what backgrounds should be right, and to charge, and to address, mainly for political parties, a shift between female and female, on the horizontal and horizontal level, and to make a complete and a match.
By the end, our initiative was taken and successfully succeeded.
Women won 17.5 percent of the national justice struggle in the first elections for 52 years.
But moreover, the euphoria of elections and the entire revolution for the whole revolution -- because every day we stopped new news about violence.
We woke up a morning with the lead for the courts of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, again, another morning, the murder rate was signed by the army.
And we were really reluctant to get into account the tyrants and their ongoing causes against human rights in prison and their defenses of laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intolerance, branch and revenge became the icon of the <unk>Folst season of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you with the success story of our rebel-and-step and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to argue that as a nation, we've made false choice and false choices.
We've misguided our priorities.
Because elections didn't bring peace or security to people, or in Lybias.
Did the rebel-off and the shift between female and male candidates bring peace and national references?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is it that our society will continue to be polarized and dominating from selfish politics of dominance and of resistance, both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only one who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gnade, and the dish.
Our society needs a national dialogue and specialization when it took the elections, which has only strengthened the polarization and settlement.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it needs to have to have the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop acting in the name of the rage, and to demand a day of revenge.
We need to start to act on the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only prevented the values, but also judged them: coughs, cooperation, not competition, not with any kind of provoking.
These are the ideals that need one of the shattering leets of war, which is desperately necessary to achieve peace.
Because peace has alchemy, and in that alchemia, it's about the interlusion of feminine and masking views.
That's the real thing.
And we need to do that in existential ways before we do it in sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace, "is the word of the Good God, rall."
The word "rahereem," again, which is known in all of the tourist traditions, has the same Arab root, like the word "rahem" -- "in mother <unk>"inspan" and symbolizes the mother's mother's maternal feminine, who surs all around the man's man's and female, and the tribes, all of them have gone through.
And just like the mother's assurance that grows in him, all around him is the basic body of compassion is the existence of life.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is going to include all things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has prelimited from my grall."
Do we all care about the gi of the gistar.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story from Kim Ilung, but we learned not much about the world outside, except that America, South Korea and Japan, our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a change-through time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me, and a letter from the sister of a colleague of mine.
It said, "If you were listening to this, our five family members will not be in the world anymore because we had nothing to eat for two weeks.
We're on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly after that, I walked past the station and saw something horrible I can't get out of my memory.
There was a dead woman on the floor, and a child in her arm was sniffing helplessly into his mother's face.
But no one helped them because they were all engaged in this, to care for themselves and their families.
In the mid-10s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
By the end, more than a million Northern Koreans were sick of victims, and many others were just surviving because they were eating grass, beetles and trees.
And the trafficfalls became increasingly common, so at night, all of it was going to be because of the lights of China on the other side of the user that we lived in.
And I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite view of North Korea and his neighbor at night.
This is the river of amollores, which is partly used as part of North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river is very illuminating and enables North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the far-distant relatives.
I just thought I was going to be apart for a short time from my family.
I never would have thought it took 14 years to revive.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea what life would be like North Carolina refugees, but I soon learned that it's not only very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Carolina refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police, and was sent to the police department.
Somebody sued me to be North Koreorean, so they tested my Chinese knowledges and they asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid of this, I thought my heart would explode.
So, I could get some assured and disengaged and disengaged,
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the question, a official said to the other, "That was a false failure.
She's not a Northorean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are signaling messages against foreign protein, but many are arrested by Chinese police and registered.
These girls were very lucky.
And although they were caught, they eventually released out because of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans were not very lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they are pledted to North Korea, where they were tortured, imprisoned or being executed publicly.
Although I was very lucky, many other North Koreans did not.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to struggle hard for survival.
And after they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be re-curted in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving myself in Southern Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I was going to be.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I noticed that, in fact, the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've come to diverge with each other because of 67 years of division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Koreans?
Where am I coming? Who am I?
Suddenly, no more land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life did not slow down, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording testimony of university.
Just when I was born to my new life, I got a pretty shocking call.
The North Kacan authorities started to remove the money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to reshape, to a remote place on the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to give an incredible route to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironry, I took a flight to China, and then moved to the north Canal border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all of them, and he started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed to be gay, and he told him they were gay, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to make it to the lazeic border, but I had to almost sample my money to bribe the border control of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was imprisoned because of illegal border resolution.
After paying money sentence and bribing, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest disadvantages of my life.
I'd done everything I could to protect my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and forth between the foreign agency and the police department, trying desperately to liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay for money or money.
I lost my hope.
And then the man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised to think that there was a stranger who was taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained to my situation and without refueling it to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I gave him all-hearted hearts and said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not going to hire you," he answered.
"I help the North Carolina people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger described to me as a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the Northern Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom was only to get there.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get to a new country, they start with little or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, education, education, and many more.
We can also stay in the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still have a lot of them in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to make the hopeful North Koreans succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you a request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be written.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditionally, and he shares it.
He's not greedy. He doesn't listen to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he's trying to make words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has an selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fairy, but he remembers the publication of every song from my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first episode of the tecubbies on my arm were on my arm and Gagas.
Don't they listen to me?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds are not fit into the social version of normal, they're often over and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and empowered my soul was that although this was the case, even though they were not considered traditional, that only one could mean was extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "cacism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's different in each individual, and that's why Remi is so different from Sam.
And the world is going to find every 20 minutes of autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing development disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been through autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a couple of months, I realized that he was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play the way that the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and he rained in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, putting the washing machine in there and eating everything that was coming under him.
And as he got older, he became different and the differences became more visible.
But behind the rage of anger and the frustas and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had been clogged.
Amazing.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wished were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is about the beauty that makes us different, and the fact that we are different, it doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And certainly, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrific of potential.
The chance to be at scale, progress and change kills in the moment that we try to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton was filled with awe and curiosity, and this photograph, on which a project of a project filled an apple and shot it through a degeneration-th-long human-long degeneration version.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto-D photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create slow-speed images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are looking out beyond our perspective, or can't even look at corners, or look inside our body with an <unk>-ray and really question what we mean with "mamera"
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- that's several fandtoseconds -- I make a package of photons that hardly has a millimeter wide, and this photon package of these photos, this project will move to light in the speed, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this projectill, you take this photon pack and you put it into that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event, you know.
So, think about it, the entire event actually takes less than a nanotone -- so long as the light needs to get back this lane -- but I'm going to push this video up to 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So in this movie, a lot is going to happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon pack that begins to move through and eventually breaks in the inside.
Part of the light is flowing out to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Most of the photons eventually end up breaking the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of a bubble that's hanging around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are moving out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on a few images at the end.
Now, if you take a standard project and leave it back the same route and slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring film -- -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little more still-lapse photograph?
You can see these waves go back to the table, the Tomate and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature is drawing a photo like this, each time a Femto image, but of course our eye is a composed of individual images.
But if you look at these individual Tomats, you'll see that when the light blows up the Tomate, it's going to stay out of the dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is turned on and the light in it jumps around and after several hundred seconds.
So in the future, if this taperto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if it's a fruit, if it's a fruit, if it's not to touch it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo with a short-term of air, you have very little light, but we're adding a billion times faster than your lowest-time recovery, so you're not getting as good as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this projectill, this photon package, a million times, and we're drawing it back and forth with very clever synchrony, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to create this information, and we've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future supercomputer, can see the edges?
The idea is that we can peel a little light on the door.
It's going to be clogged, go into the space, it's going to be reflected in the back of it, and eventually it's going to be reflected back to the camera, and we could use this more magnifular increase of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a puppet is hidden, and we're going to have the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the N Nature.com, it was released by its physiology, and they created this animation.
We're going to add this light project and we're going to push it on this wall, and the photon packs are going to migrate into all directions, and some of the photons will access our hidden soup, which will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they'll be able to get closer to the light.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our FemtoL camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time-consuming, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point belongs to.
By taking a laser and using a laser, we can take a raw image that can see what you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take a lot of these images, we can put together dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the various light-throughputations, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our evolution.
We've got a little bit more work to do before we can make it work from the lab, we can build cars that are preventing collisions and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous distances, looking at the light, looking at it through open windows, or we can build endcates that are able to see deep inside the body, and see yakcros.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, which is really a term for scientists to think about, now, about Femto-Aid photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as at Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, has become an art of art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data we collected every time, not only a scientific image, but we can also create a new form of computer photography with color captureings, with color captureings, and we can only look at the waves between time.
But it's also something that's kind of funny.
If you look at those waves under the bottleneck, you can see the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we're almost in the speed of light, we've had weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this image incredibly.
The sequence in which events are occurring in the world will appear in a more mature order, so that by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, whether it's to focus on photography or to create a new visualization tool for medicine or new exhibits, since our invention, we've been able to open all the data and detail on our website and hope that the Spiderakers, the creative community, and the research community, we should stop showing us that we should stop to the megabyte of cameras, and we should start to start to start to fix the next cameras.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the road so that a lot of deliberation doesn't get passed through, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and broplons and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much rented my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the remote buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the vacant houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the giant oysts, which has been to give love for hundreds of years, drunk and juniper shadow. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time you never, in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned areas in America.
I live near this house thinking about how I could make it go. And I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I was thinking a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratitude for my life, and it made me realize what is important to me in life now.
But it's hard for me to keep this view on every day.
It's easy to lose your life-to-day life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I would transform a side of the abandoned house into a giant blackboard and write with a treasure of the gaps: "If I die, I want to get ... Anybody who can come in, I can take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public space.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled with the wall, and it kept growing.
I want to share some sentences that were written by the people on the wall.
"Only I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Only I die, I want to stand on the International World Cup frantry."
"Only I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Only I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Only I die, I want to live on a "connected."
"On to whom I die, I want to hold it back to my arms."
"Only I die, I want to be somebody from Kavallery."
"Only I die, I want to be completely myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for admissions and thinking and remembering what's most important as we grow and changing.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a kit together, and now we've built a building in countries like Kazhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to speak out and share our voices more and more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is too short and sensitive.
We often are being held by talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I realized that the preparation for death is one of the things that strengthening us most.
And the idea of death is how we're trying to get life to know.
Our common places are the best to show us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, fears and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in dedicated mathematics. I'm interested in a special problem for anyone who's engaged in a rigorous mathematics, is that we're like a business executive agent.
Nobody knows what we're doing, actually.
So today, I'm going to try and explain to you what I'm doing.
dancing is one of the most human activity.
We are celebrating at the sight of the master Ballett and the cheekers you'll see.
So, for Ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and potentially a fundamental determination that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It's what it does to my foreman, Jan Abri Interpling, who, at the time, was a ballet-death.
Over the years, we've been making a lot of progress in the treatment.
But still, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the disarmable symptoms like weakness, tremor, Steifidity and others who live that disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know is, is there any way to cure, if we have an objective metric to answer that question.
Now, in trouble, for Parkinson's and other movements, there's no biomarkers, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing to do is to have this 20-minute test in neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never ever done.
But what if patients were going to do that test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a very expensive hospital worker.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to look at the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual uselesss like my Sudan-s Abrixtpling.
Here's a video of vibrating mood sounds.
This is what happens in a healthy state when someone makes voice sounds, we can look at the moody ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs, if we can make sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And like Ballet, it requires an enormous amount of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to have to learn until it's learning.
By the loud, we can determine the position of vibrating moods, and just like the limbs are affected by the vocal commands of Parkinson's disease.
You can see, on the bottom, an example of irregular vocal delusion.
We always see the same symptoms.
True, weakness, eifess.
The language is going to become even more livers and more colorful, and that's an example of it.
Now, this effects on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision disorder analysis software combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now see where someone lies in a period between disease and health, just because of the clones.
How can the testing be measured by clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
So little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of these are exactly the wrong ones, not the misinformation of experts.
So they can be conducted on their own.
They're very fast, very much 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large order.
And we can now get to the amazing goals.
We can reduce logististic difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to have routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data from conventional observation.
We can perform cheap mass care for clinical trials, and we can get a study of the whole population to be able to do things that are truly disruptive.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's voice-recitiative.
With a CATab and PatientsLikeMe, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough output data for the success of these goals.
We have calls, the three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call it cheaply to leave images for a few cents. I'll be familiar with pleasure that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient, while the caller, needs to tell if this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be able to get there until the end.
But we collect a huge database in different circumstances, which is interesting. The circumstances are important because we are in order to exploit it to determine what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is there?
It's much better.
My student Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done this fantastic work -- has shown that it's also working on the cellular network, which allows this project to do, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this an improvement.
So people can call them the phone, they can call them the test and they can call the test. People could call them Parkinson's disease so they could take their voice so that their doctor could check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max mobil, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the back of the back, you see the cows of my father, and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only involved in the south, which means that wildlife can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only can of the bore.
My tribe, the colony of the Masai, believes that we would come together with our animals and our wildlife habitats of the sky, which is why our animals mean so much.
Ever as a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our terrorist atheist. They protect our tribe and our ancestry. They also have been on this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think it's because there's so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years was responsible for his father's cows. That's what it was for me.
I had to figure out a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it was helping the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on going.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's search.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the birdbit, and they go again, but the next time they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach out, and they kill our livestock.
I stopped the storing one night. I walked around with a torch in the hand, and this time the lions didn't interrupt.
lions fear light moving.
I had an idea.
Even as a young boy, I worked in my bedroom all day, and once again, I took the new radio of my mother apart, and the day it almost took me to learn a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy-controlled label from a motorcycle, which suggests whether you want to turn to the right or the left. It blinds.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and turn the lights on.
This is a little pearl in from a broken flaphlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is actually carrying the battery, which is providing electricity to the correct system. I call it a transformator.
And the policy system is blinking.
You can see that the pears are pointing outward, because it's where the lions come from.
And this is what happens for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions believe that I'm going around the rub, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I was working with this at home, and since then, we had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they work really well.
My idea now is used across Kenya, including other predators, or hyena, and the lights also serve to keep elephants remotely from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is dedicated to fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's nowhere, and I'm showing people how to use it.
I only saw a boy from the savanna who was cooking cows, and I saw planes about me and said, "I'll sit in a room!"
And here I am now.
I was invited to do a plane show for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to ban lions. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can bring the lions together. We can live on a side with lions without any argument.
Ash<unk><unk>n<unk> Oln. In my language, I thank you.
You don't even know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electrical fence. A electroz fence?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yes, I've tried it before, but I've been back to the test because I got a blow.
All at the very beginning, Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, and I've got photography, I'm passionate about it, but today I want to share with you at 15 of my favorites, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no way to shoot a picture, no one could even take it. Not even had any reaction to it.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story started when I was a speaking in New York, and my wife made this picture that I would hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
Just a year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this goes from.
When my daughter came closer to her third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina not to New York and do a father-in-law turn to continue the ritual?"
And then we started asking the story of dozens and dozens of tourists to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're giving a complete stranger a camera.
Nobody's ever said no, and fortunately, nobody's ever been touched by our camera.
And then we didn't know how much of these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a coincidence moment, or a specific journey.
They're also a chance for us to stay in October for a week, to stop time and change our time and how we change ourselves from year to year, not only physical but in particular, to reflect.
Because, although we always do the same picture, our view of time changes as time. As it's always reaching new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, and how it's dealing with everything and how it sees.
This very intense time we spend on each other is something we value and expect for free every year.
Last but, during one of our travels, we went for a walk, and suddenly they remained as if they were fixed, it shows a red mark on a red mark on a dollboard that they had learned as a young kid at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old, that she had exactly this moment.
She said that she remembered her heart breaking out of her chest when she saw the store for the first nine years ago.
And now they look at high schools in New York because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized, obviously, the most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious capacity of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photograph.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I'd like to urge each of you to come up with this image today and not ask someone, "Would you take a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 26.43, 57.0/33.8/21.4/13.7 (BP=0.964, ration=0.965)
