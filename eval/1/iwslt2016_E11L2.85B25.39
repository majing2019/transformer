When I was 11 years old, I was dipped one morning from the sounds of the most bizarre joy.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly depressed by the news.
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but my father obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was complaining about five years as a boy and I was committing my older sister who had no longer been able to go to a secret school.
And we were only able to go to school.
Every day we took another way, so nobody could guess where we went.
We're eating our hidden books in shopping bags so that it looked like we're just going to buy.
We've been done in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
Over and over again, the class had to be worse for a week, because the Taliban had been swallowed.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Did they stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we were still going to go to school.
I had grown up with a great fortune in a family where education was important and valued and daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign opponents from a remote province of Afghanistan. He insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was violated by his father.
My mother was a teacher who was trained.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- the first one in his family ever received an education.
And it was always clear that his children would receive education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of not sending his kids to school.
I know that in the years of the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, from the continuous fear and the interrelability.
I was a good joke to give up. But my father said, "Toy, boy, stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced from your house in war.
But one thing that's going to be on is that what's in this room. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have higher degree as a professor, and if my family didn't have been used so much to my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly unnant of the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family because he was told to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who was congratulating me.
He's not just about my college degree, but also because I'm the first woman and I'm the one who runs him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education of women.
And so I helped build the wireless, the first and possibly the only intern for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school classes are still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school are willing to see all of the opportunities they're offering.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, like my parents at the time, despite me, and against all the constraints.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he was walking home from SOLA to her village, and they were dead through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he got home, the phone rang and a voice attacked him if he was sending his daughter to school, they would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to kill me now, if you want, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game because of your old and over-the-day ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've found something that is often dismissed in the West: the majority of us have the success, is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that her success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not important in our success.
They're often the ones who are very confident and persuasive to be a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
Now, under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, they are pushing over three million girls to the faculty bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen from America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the change are not long and change with the decline of the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unfinished possibility, and every day, the girls who are leaving the SOLA.
And just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including my life, was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, I worked on the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia to projects with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years ago, we thought that we're Italian, and we're really good at work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found.
Our first project, which was inspired by the "Ripples of B of Zambezi, was one of the things that we used to show the people of Sambique, how to raise food.
We came up with Italian seed seeds in Southeast Asia, in this shiny valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local citizens of the Asian tomatoatoes and to Anchini.
Of course, the local authorities had no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such fertile land in which there was no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they don't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Mew, in time to save the people of Sambias from the starvation."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-pogged tomatoes. In Italy, they became so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambers, "Look, just like agriculture."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, about 200 nilers from the river were all over the night.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian, so great, in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French were doing, and after I saw what they did, I became pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least in the nilene.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've never called the unrestual African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, it's a post-colian economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read her book.
So read from a African woman, which we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root, "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I suffer every other culture as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronision: I suffer every other culture as if they were my servant.
And so white people in Africa are called "brust," boss,
I was cured when I read the book "Sallall" of singing. He said, especially in economics, when people don't want help, they keep it alone.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
And this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground, and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neococolential?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react to people and create a system called business fund, which never is being launched, no one is motivated, but you're going to be the service of the local talent, the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never ever achieve a community with ideas, you sit with a local home.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have any entrepreneurs, and you never will say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what their chances are.
You have this light-up configuration.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be in public meetings.
We work to do one to do this, we need to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the business manager, the shop manager of the business company, who sits in your house with you, your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way of changing life.
I tried this in a section, West epidemics,
I tried to escape at the time, to avoid the flush, where we tell others what to do.
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first clients. And I helped him. He put fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and to organize, and then the fishermen came, and they said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fishers, working together, and I did not sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany, 60 cents per million.Kilo, but to Japan for 15 dollars of sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them?" Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Do you mind it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been working on our development of 40,000 companies.
There's a new generation of companies who are going to go to loneliness.
Peter MRI, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter MRI was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Make is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
You know, planning is the death of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch to know what the smartest man Christelard wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get you to one of those.
You have to provide them disclosion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
We are getting 200 customers in a community of 10,000 people.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
For what presentation have you most applauded this morning?
<unk>"Cear, passionate people. You've cheated this one.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- un-spiring fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The reforestation species are not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, build, transport, and can undermine them with them.
The technologies don't exist for that.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget!
The government? You forget!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were stacked up, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a binary: The city of New York wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve, and they said, if the population grows on this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to get people to get them, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they've already been in the crap.
In 1860 they see the dirty technology that's eating lives from New York.
What happens? Forty years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had done the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered disclosion.
They don't come from the first. They don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is provide them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all have to be able to do three things: to sell to market market, to be great, to be the market market, and the financial agency has to be enormous.
You know what?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
This is not what we have.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iystiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westhouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, just one thing: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in North Korea, and we start teaching them the class to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransobiography, and the job is the 16-year-old is to support two sides of Richard Bransobiography, as often as the word "I'm going to use and often the word "weells."
Never "a" and 32 times we're "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody built a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small entrepreneur background in the cafeteria and Bars. Their committed buddy, who are doing what someone who has done for this gentleman who talks about this vague. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate leadership to help them find the means of the resources and the people, and we found that the wonders of the local population can be changed by the culture and the economy of this community, just by understanding the passion and energy and imagination of their imagination.
Thank you.
I've learned about five years ago how to be, to be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- to give educational education into communication.
I was scared.
Fear in the right. Fear among these students with their large brains and their large books and their big, I don't trust people.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she went down to the can of the shrimp and saw a door in a completely new world.
And I felt like I was talking to the students. I was amazed about the thought they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our science scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and our engineers are the ones who are addressing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religious scientist.
But these great conversations don't work when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up with us.
I want to show you some of the ways that you can do, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is: Okay, and what?
Now, why is your scientific area so relevant to us?
Not only do you think that their catats are examining, but also tells us that their catadores, the gloves, the light structure in our bones, because they're important to understand and treat oopalosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you're making out of useless arguments.
In arguments, there are a barrier to the understanding of your mind.
I'm sure you could use your "funk and time" and you know, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is a lot more intuitive for us?
We have a little bit of understanding of your mind, not the same as to put down the same as their level.
As Einstein said, "Tait things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, a few things are about this: examples, stories and analogies. So in this way, you can pull us into your bannann.
And when you put your work up, then let's take the spots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "Eich point?"
What happens when someone is over? Another one is just taken out of it, and with those dots, your first favorite audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but also also very much of the conversation processing of our brain, and by doing so, we're quickly challenged.
This is an example of Gene Lindve Brown that's much more effective, and it shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use one single, just to use an awkward sentence where the audience, if it's lost the thread, can counter it, use images and graphics that also stimulate our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up this door and see the miracle land that is coming up with science and technology.
And because the engineers I've taught me to make the phone contact with the <unk>Nield in me, I want to sum up all the way with an equation.
Look at your science and your preconceptions and your preconceived, share them through the relevance, so the audience says, what's important, and multiply the whole thing with your passion that you have for your incredible work: and that's what you're doing with incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you have solved this equation, I'm really looking for myself.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
You can change a cell phone and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can dial a message and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a cell phone, you can put it up on soundoud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed them.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who were coming from and asking change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. an Android, a Blackberry, wow.
These are many. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.8 lines are full of information.
Data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. has set up a right line.
So this rule is called a policy line for the protection of the law enforcement.
This rule is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who is sending an email?
Who are they sending a text?
And when you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet provider.
And all over Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this plan for protection.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were pouring out on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Don't forget."
And some people even said this could be on Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Chumopeizei in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German Telegraph, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, I'll send all the information that you've stored over me.
And I once asked her, and I asked her, and I didn't get a right answer. Just a smaller blue bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's happening with it.
So I decided to put a court process against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the counter-clateg said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take back the bill, which is why they all have to send me some information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court department decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was the German legal issue.
So I got this ugly brown, brown strip with a CD.
And the CD was this.
35.830 lines of information.
First I saw it, and I said, well, it's a giant file. My hand.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it out of the way.
Because I want to show people what is called the protection system.
So with the time of online and open data, I have done this here.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see me walking from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>nn<unk>s, and how many calls I'm going to walk.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking to each other a few times.
And then I call myself some friends and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said to the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, it might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it would have happened.
And then, not the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today's government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it at a more and more and longer.
But even self-detord and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you say your boss, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information that you've stored on.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Complete shops, rapid-talk restaurants, Brakall.
So the urban planners come together and they thought about changing the name of South Central so that it's going to change it for something else, it changed it into South Los Angeles, as if that changes in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
So, in total stores, rapid-talking restaurants, bureaucratic spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivehrus and the Drivebys.
The comic is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drive-bys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles from a remote illness.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't do that anymore.
And I wondered how you felt if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go from the house, the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to make the sound that the skirts are bought and sold like plant spaces.
I see dialogue centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
I didn't like to have a little bit of a three-minute tax to get an apple that's not medial.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's 45 to three feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay in."
And I decided to hold it in that way.
So I came up and my group, L.A. Green Growers, and we started planting my food heat and fruit trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-performance group, composed of outsiders from all the social layers and from all the city, it's totally free and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically handed me a pre-step, and said I had to remove my garden, the charge was a statement.
And I thought, "Yeah, go on, right?
Give a narrative of how to grow food in a piece of land that is totally not true?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't be.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and with the city bank, and with a member of Green Ground. They signed a petition on Change.org, and we had 900 regulations. We were successful.
We were holding the victory in the hands.
My city bank even called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. The United States has the most real estate space in the property of the city.
They have 67 kilometers in Brakall.
This is 20 Central Parks.
This is enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell should not find that well?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my seduction, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconcessible reality that's made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Working is my graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's pounding walls, I'm making lawns and sewage equipment.
I use the garden, the soil, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my favoritely for this stuff.
You'd be surprised, which of the ground floor can be used if you use it as canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunblower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would be wondering how kids are influenced by it.
and gardeners are the most therapeutic and humier act of action you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And then you get strawberry.
I remember this time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad, because they were there, and I said to them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the foundation for the road."
I've been embarrassed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do this. People said, "Fin, you're not afraid that people are going to steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid that she's squeaks.
It's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless homeless home in All downtown L.A.
These are the guys who have helped me to charge the laster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green Growers have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people in our circlations, and they came up with each other, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, kids eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of them, if they don't show them how food and body influence them, they eat, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see color kids that are exactly on the path that they were, and they don't lead to it.
I think the gardeners are a chance to train these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipging container and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free cook, because free is not sustainable.
The cometic of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids from the streets, and letting them experience the joy and the pride and honor when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gang, gang thinkers.
We have to turn the picture of gangs.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to become a puppet, right?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me with me, don't call me when you're sitting in the crazy chairs and you want to make a meeting where you talk about, you know, you're going to make any jokes.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skate, in my garden so that we can plant any snail.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nollyjoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nollyjoster" means "notable politicians."
Even though a newspaper hoster gave birth to a better definition: "A Snollyjoster is somebody who is planning for a faculty, independent of party, program or program, and his success is achieved by the pure power of the gealyptic determination.
I have no idea what the toy is.
Something about words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all the politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
So 1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not the same word "write of debut."
And this actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went through the parliament.
and they threw it in the London Tower, and they gave him a hug, but he was courageous enough, he was courageous enough to stand, and he ended up with so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so" is much like Brass." Many people think.
And it turns out the English word for the wheel.
But that's not true. It's about a convicted agent of the press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you with the United States at the time they've just reached independence.
And you looked at the question of, how to call George Washington, the head of the head.
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
In Congress, it was consistently discussed for a long time.
And there were all sorts of possible ways to make it possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, their highness of George Washington, and again, the regulations of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
Not so much of a shame.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that that was a waste.
They weren't monarchistist, they wanted the king to choose for a specific period.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with a paper, because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the diary's book that always writes, "I'm going to have the same issue."
The reason for the delay, and the long-lill was that the demographic house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good. They didn't want to.
King might call it, and maybe he could give it to ideas about his success.
They wanted to give him the most humest, most coughing, horrifying titles that they thought about.
This title was "Pice."
President. They didn't invent the title. But he existed before. But he only meant that someone was signed by a collection.
So something like the precaution of a jury.
He didn't have the size anymore, as the term "wart," or "wug water."
Sometimes there were little civilians and government groups, but it was really an unmanned title.
And so the Senate refused to throw it down.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign and meet foreign puppets.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, the word "Sountor" is meant to use, but they wanted to make absolutely clear that they were not meant to be honest of their respect for the opinions and institutions of civil nations, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's "The World Bank is respected," not necessarily the foreignity of the United States -- that the president of the United States, the other foreignities, the foreign nations.
You can learn three interesting things.
First of all, and I think that's the best -- so far so far, I can't find out if the Senate ever has been officially validated the president.
Barack Obama, Obama, just cheated the title. He just waits it to the fact that the Senate is active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something temporary is -- then you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today sounds not so humbling, right?
This has more than 5,000 nucleic crises, which he has and the largest economy in the world and a flomatociar drone and all that stuff.
The reality and story have given the size.
And so the Senate ended.
They've got a respecting title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the counter of self-destess -- well now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house department lost, because no one feels humbling when you're told that you're the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually, the reality changes more than the words that the reality might ever be.
Thank you.
So I came in a truck with about 50 rebellors with a battle to Stalialabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm painting my black Conclight, against a pair of brown leather-in-in-tathers and a rocket in the direction of the government that I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been big before the war, but next to Pyjama party and football talks and commirors and commirors with racist South America and non-religious protesters who live with the "No-No-No-No-distism" and Afghanistan" and I'd been painting and rewording events before I knew.
But this is the geography of the self.
And so I'm here today, I'm standing here, I'm a man-made Afghane, South-state art enforcement study of God Gnades, and a radical political artist who's been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So in Afghanistan, there's a lot of great things that you could do about art, but I personally don't like painting rain slows. I want to make art that draws creativity and characterism and re-expression the reality and the reality and even the kind of imaginative people to try to make the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad --Gangster who is doing his jihad against communists like "Pophead" and used abusive religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad strike do, as to the parliament, and to do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I doing jihad! And I'm rich."
And I'm trying to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi who are spending themselves as national heroes.
I want to go to Afghanistan and go to the bottom, with a project called "Rape," where you're going to be a cop, build a false control control on the streets of Kabul and drive cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, giving them money and giving them money into the name of Kabul, and the police in Kabul, and they hope that they will be 100 percent of us.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, I think, in my opinion, in the developing conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I would be able to fill up a localized and a conservation bag with a plant or a number of rebeled, or a re-friendly, un-friendly, un-friendly, woolly-like,
And I'd like to see what a simple reception from Kabul between Kipling Appell of 1899 to create a dialogue about that today's development institutions have its roots in the past Colombian rhetoric about the "The White Beem" to protect the brown man themselves and even to protect them a little bit.
But for all of these things, you can get into prison, they can be misdiagnosed, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, just said.
I feel like this is now building an unconditional tension in the room, because I shouldn't have that dress.
Fortunately, I have something to change with this.
This is the first time someone walks into the TED stage, so you can appreciate the most happy to see this.
If some women were really really dumb, when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read it on Twitter later.
I also find that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short seconds what you think of.
Nobody else has the chance.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it wasn't that way to be so awkward as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should use my back oil and hold my hand in the hair of this guy.
And beyond the surgery or the wrongness that I took from two days ago to work, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and that we have our utterance -- even though it's superficial and ineffective -- is a big impact on our lives.
To be fear, for me, is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm an model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the more honest way.
The first question is, "How do you become a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is this legacy.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, in which it is technically programmed, but also as big, charm and bright,
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that was taken for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe some fashionist cheers, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smalls. Lih."
And first of all, I'm commenting your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU has counted all the modules on the length, each one that was exploited, and that 677 modules were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always been asked to me is, "Can I be an model if I'm grown?"
And I said to you, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you is, "Why?
You know what? You can do everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventors of the next Internet, or a Ninja psychiatric expert, which would be totally wrong, because then you're the first one."
And if you still say this amazing counterword, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become an model," then I say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the head of the American bird or the business of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meel.
To say that you're going to want to be a model later, that's like saying you're going to get the Jack 101 in the lottery.
You can't influence it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to demonstrate a few years from the past, and I'm going to demonstrate a model of invention, because in other ways, the heart surgery can only escape it.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo," then the leg goes first, and long, and that arm goes back to the back, and the head is on the front of the side, and you just move back to three-quarters, and you just look back and you see 300 times, and you look back, and you're going back, you
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finish school and you have a lot of jobs and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say much, and if you say that President of the United States is going to be president, but in your lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at a little bit weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Am all the photos going on?"
And yes, as much as the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was also the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's now relatively personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the Shootings.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a Shooting for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructors, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeupists and photographers and Stylists and all of their assistants and the adoption and the development production. They're not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "You're fighting stuff for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-m-mel-mel shoes that I can't wear, except just the things I get free, things that I get in real life and I don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you had me wear for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and they were walking over a red light bulb, and of course we were stopped. It took me a "Excuse me, Mr. Winner," and we've done it on.
I've got these costless things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying attention to their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and filtered last year, were 85 percent black and Latino, and most young men.
It's only 17,000 young, male and Latinos who don't ask for, "Who am I listening?"
But I said, "How many times am I going to stop? When I'm stopped?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thinner and you have glowing hair, then you feel very happy and so fulfilled."
And then we're going to give you an answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said before, is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel confident because every day I have to think about my appearance.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thinest legs and the most spinniest hair and the coolest flakes, and they're probably the same because of their appearance, of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I've been preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to me to get a more honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable about to get here and say, "I got all the benefits of a pile that I've been attracted to my power," and it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that's not always going to make me happy."
It was very difficult to give a legacy of oppression because of gender and race when I'm one of the biggest users.
I'm also happy, and I'm honored to stand here, and I find it great that I've done here before 10 or 20 years, and my career has passed, because I'd probably not say how I got my first job, or maybe I'd not tell you how I've paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our insite and misinformation rather.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who's been in exile about life: "Son, drunk Gaddafi. Stit him.
But never will be a Gaddafi revolution.
It's been almost two years since the Libby Revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass destruction in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I joined up with many other Libyers, and outside and outside of Bryens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime Gadis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, gay women and men stood in the first row, asked the end of the regime, had spogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved some prominant courage by being put on the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east above the distant West, to the South.
After a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 dead, we were able to free our country and to drop the tyranny.
Gaddi has left a big warrior, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for the end of the day.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed tyrannic regimes both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the supernatural society.
The destruction and the challenges, I called, as many other women, started to rebuild the civil society of Lyania, and we demanded a participatory and a redesigned transition to democracy and national equilibrium.
Occasionally, 200 organizations have been founded, and immediately after Gaddafis, in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years of exile, I came back to Lybacia, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform of Libyters, a movement of women, leaders from different life, whose goal is to be public, public for the societic empowerment of women, and to our right, to the right of our right, to act of justice, to the democracy and peacebuilding development.
I found myself in a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish political politics of dominance and execution.
I led a initiative to create the leadership platform between Libyant women to achieve a policy law, a law, any citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to vote for the right and to the political parties, and to the political parties between the female and the broad and the Russian and the horizontal level, to try to make a decision to make a difference.
At the end, our initiative has been taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's national justice officer in the first elections for 52 years.
But it was pretty, but the euphoria of the elections and the whole revolution after <unk> because every day we were pushing new messages to new violence.
The morning we turned to the marriage of the ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of American ambassadors and the attack on the message.
And then, one day later, the murder rate of police were signed by the army.
And really every day, we were facing the sovereignty of the military and their ongoing challenges against the human burden and their disengaging of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intolerance, and riff, became the icons of the <unk>Folime era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success history of our reception and the elections.
I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, who have made false choice and wrong choices.
We've done our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety in Lybia.
Did the appropriate and the change between female and male candidates have taken peace and national reconciliation?
No, it's not.
So what is it?
Why is it that our society is going to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and the unpredictability, both men and women?
Perhaps women were not the only ones that missed this, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the one.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus as it took the elections, which ultimately has strengthened the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop the name of the anger and to ask a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of empathy and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that only value value, but also compelled to do: Gnade instead of revenge, instead of collaboration, instead of a competition, instead of a lack of it.
These are the ideals that desperately need one of the rapted lybacia to achieve peace.
Because peace has a nightmare, and in those alchemia, it's about the interstellation of feminine and masks.
That's the real balance.
And we have to do this in a way that we can do it in a way before we do it a societic.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," "I peace" -- "is the word of the Good of God, yelling."
The word "raheem," again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arab root as the word "thhy" -- "Lood" and symbolized the maternal feminine, all around the world, the man's man's man's man and the female, all the tribes have been over.
And just like the mother's assaulting the embryo that grows in it, completely surrendered the basic posture of compassion to the whole existence.
And so we said, "My Gnade is all about anything."
And so we said, "My Gnade has a pre-ford before my grall."
We all want to be the art of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we have the story of Kim Cllung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Even though I was often wondering how the outside world is, I thought I'd spend my whole life in North Korea to change anything.
At age seven, I first saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter in 1996, from my sister of a colleague of mine.
And it said, "If you look at this, our five family members are not going to be on the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
I went through the station, and I looked at something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A flowering woman was on the ground, and a pounding child in her arm was flashing helpless in the face of his mother.
But no one helped them because everyone was busy doing so on caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were the ones of famine, and many others survived because they ate grass, and the trees were eating the blood.
Air accidents have been more and more and more and more likely to be dried at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the pyramid that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amad, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
And as you can see, the river can be very, very smoothly overweight, and it enables Northstans to escape.
But many are dying.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took me 14 years to revive.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of how life would be as Northstadian refugees, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Koreans are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught up by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody told me to be the Northstan, so they tested my Chinese events and gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart was explode.
If anything unnatural, I could be locked and signed.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer questions.
After they finished the review, a lawyer said to the other, "This was a false failure.
She's not an Northstorean."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are signing messages against foreign messages likeylyl, but many are caught and signed up by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they finally got released out of enormous international pressures.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they were expelled to North Korea, where they were tortured, imprisoned or publicly.
Even though I was lucky at the distance, there are many other North Koreans who don't do that.
It's tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identity and fighting hard to survive.
After she's learned a new language and she's found work, her world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea and start a new life.
I was able to let go out of South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside of us, we've been diverged from a very different set, because of 67 years of the division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstan?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no land that could have been my home.
Even though the adaptation of the Southern Korean life did not slow, I had a plan.
I was interested in the recording of the university.
I just became more informed about my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Bronx administration started to take the money that I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to reside in a remote place in the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their flight.
North Koreans have to have an incredible route back to the freedom of their path.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took back to the north Pacific border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to license them, to more than 2,000 miles through China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't think of Chinese, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese official gave up my family, I agreed, and he said to him that they were suicidal, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We were able to do it all the way up to the lavope border, but I had to almost look at all my money to bribe the border control of Laos.
But even after we've gone across the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest attacks of my life.
I've done everything I could to avoid my family to freedom, and we've been so close to it, but my family has been arrested just before the Southern Korean Embassy.
I went from between immigration and police department to try to desperately clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back and pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then I asked the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger was concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without complaining, he went to a banking store, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I sat up with him from my heart and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, I've been symbolized for a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hopeful, the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were reintroduced together in Southern Korea, but the freedom of getting is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the English, the education and the education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I would like to make my hopeful Northstans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have a request today.
I'm not saying I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he can communicate joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them unconditionally, and he shares them.
He's not greedy. He's not laughing on the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine: He never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be on words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely outrageous memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate lady, but he reminds me of the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations about when he was four, while the first episode of the teystett on my arm was to have been on my arm and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't they listen to me? They don't listen?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind is not in the social version of normal, they're often over and understood.
But what I'm encouraged by my heart, and my soul has empowered, was that although this was the case, even though they were not seen as normal, that only one could mean, that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
It's different in every individual, so Remi is so different from the other.
And the world is found every 20 minutes in a new autism category, and even though it's one of the fastest growing disabilities in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm living autism, but I can't remember without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row in the room, and eating everything that was out of his own.
And as he got older, the differences became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the frust, and the never-discovery hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had ever been.
Amazing.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to compete against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different, doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance to be size, progress and change is dying in the moment that we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edogon has been filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo on a project that we took an apple and we took a half-th-th-th-halfth-th-th-th-halfth-th-th-century version of a project.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto-A photographer, a new engineering technology that's so fast, that they can create time-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look out of our perspective to look out at corners or see an <unk>-ray in our bodies and really ask what to do with "Mamera"
Now, if I take a laser back and I light it in a billionth of a second -- this is multiple Femone -- I make a package of photons that are barely a vertical, and this photon package, this project will move into light, and say, a million times a second, a normal project.
So if you take this project, you take these photons package and you put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, you think, the whole event actually takes less than a nanosis -- so long as you need the light to get back this lane -- but I'm going to add this video to the factor of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, and it turns into the bottle with a photons package, which starts to move through and then break the inside.
Part of the light is flowing out of the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually achieve the friction of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a snow bubble that's going around in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and you let it go back the same track and you slow the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, one week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-time photograph?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomces and the wall flattened over in the back of the back.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
And it seemed like the natural nature was painting this picture, each one of the time a Femto image, but of course our eye is a single-body picture.
But if you look at this Tomva, you'll see that when the light blows over the Tom Passage, it's going to keep it in the dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming, and the light jumps around in her head and comes back after a few billionth of a second.
So in the future, if this tapto camera is embedded in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is closed, without touching it at all.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short-time period, you have very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your shortest energy rate, so you're not getting as good as you.
So what we do is we send this project, this photons package, a million times, and we draw this back and over again with very clever synchronization, and we combine these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make them invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes: Can they see corners?
The idea is that we're lighting a little light on the door.
It's going to be cluttered, into the space, a part of it is reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we can use these more magnifular pulses of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
Behind the wall is a puppet hidden, and we're going to let the light go out of the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be rid of this light project, and they're going to push it up to this wall, and this photons are all set up in all directions, and some of the photons are going to reach our hidden soup, which then we're going to break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons, and then they'll come back to the camera in a very, very, very,
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time resolution, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance on the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So if we can light a laser, we can take a raw image, which -- like you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but then we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light circuit, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a lot more to do before we can do this from the lab to practice, we could build cars that are out of the collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can search on dangerous injury by looking at light, and we can see the window, or we can build endosotos, and we can see deep in the body of the glass and soils around the glass of the river.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, so this is really a test call for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like a few seconds, at Doc Edogon, even a scientist, the science has become an art of ultra-grainy photography, and I realized that all of the data we collect every time is not just the scientific process. We can create a new form of computer photography with color and color, and we can't just look at the waves between each other, and we can't just look at the waves between the surface of the wave between each other.
But it also happens a little bit of a fun here.
If you look at the waves under the bottleneck, you can see the waves of us move away.
The waves should be about to move us.
What's happening here?
And it turns out that we're almost in light speed, we've got some weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
The sequence that happens in the world is appearing in a continuous order, so by using the relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether we're trying to focus around photography, or to create a new imaging tool for medicine or new exhibitions, since we've been able to do all the data and details on our website, and hope that the "Satership" and the creative community, and the research community that we should stop to try to start to start to start the micro-mixels of the next micro-dimensional micro-dimensional structure, and the next digital camera, and the
Thank you. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people like our people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so many fears don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like tiny ones and scons and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying with each other?
How do we divide our memories from the remote buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for sustained homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the vast eavesdles that have been defending for hundreds of years of loving, drunk and inertian shadows. I trust a city where there are always music.
I don't think every time anyone ever gets in New Orleans, there's a parade.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most left-up worms in America.
I live in the near of this house thinking about how I can make it more, and so I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009,
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a big gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I'm interested in in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep my point every day.
It's easy to lose and forget, which is really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned one side of the abandoned house into a giant board, and I wrote with a plaque that says, "I'd die," I want to be able to get everybody who walks, I can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was totally filled, and it grew.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I'd die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"I'm dying, I want to stand on a broad-time over the International data line."
"I'd like to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd like to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'd like to die, I want to live "weardless."
"I'd die, I'd like to keep it in my arms."
"I'd like to die, I want to be somebody of Kavallill."
"I'd die, I'd like to be myself."
This neglected place was a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the harsh times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding them in a new and unstable way.
It's about creating space forums and thinking and remembering what's most important in the process as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction box, and now in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces, if we have the opportunity to go up and share our voices with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often judged to talk about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen us.
The idea of death is how we think about life.
Our common positions are the best to show us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people around us can't just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in a more aggressive math. I'm involved in a special problem for anyone who is busy experimenting with more elaborate mathematics, is that we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so today, I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activity.
We're clawed in the sight of the trauma ballet and the waves, as you're going to see.
If Ballett is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental propulsion that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. That also makes it my local-forded Jan Abriulation, who was a ballogen that was in his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
But nevertheless, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unconditional symptoms like weakness, tremor, pearility and others who are causing this disease, so we need objective means to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know if there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
The trouble is that there are no biomarkers of control, so you can't do very simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it never will.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
This would save a training tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to have a expensive hospital service.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurologic department.
So I want to propose you a unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because in some sense, we're all, virtual, like my star quiration.
You can see a video of the vibrant vocal lobets.
This happens in a healthy state, if someone is making speech sounds, we can look at ourselves as a coherent ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make the sound, and we all have the genes for this. FoxP.
And like balletet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to speak until they learn to speak.
And by the way, we can determine the position of the vibrant vocal lobets, and like the limb is also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
And so you can see an example of the lower term for irregular vocal sounds of print.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
True, weakness, hip, hipness.
The language is even more and more fry and fuzzy, and that's an example of this.
And this effects can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision effects of technology, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, so we can now tell you where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the mood.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
And the infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for this.
And both are exactly exactly exactly the same. They're not doing the same tests of experts.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
And we can do this amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logististic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through a broad observation.
We can do cheap amounts of intervention for clinical trials, and we can first be able to make a research of the entire population.
We now have the possibility of looking for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
We're going to do the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's Law of the past.
With Aculab and patient'sikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data, for the results of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, without Parkinson's disease, can call cheaply, to leave a few cents for a few cents. I'm known to be the fact that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say 10,000 people, can you say who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the phone has to tell if this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be done until the end.
But we collect a huge database, among various conditions, which is interesting. These conditions matter, because we are in order to set up this, to try to figure out what exactly the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
At the moment, your 86 percent of the time is the accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make it a great job because he did this fantastic work -- has shown now that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we are at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
So people can -- people can call the phone and make the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, they could take their voice so that their doctor could check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern border of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, so that means that wildlife can escape the park anytime.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only bumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we were with our animals and the Wildlife of the sky, so our animals are so much.
As a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our hearts. They're also on the basis of this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible between six and nine years for the cows of his father. So I was like this.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the coward.
But lions are very clever animals.
You come, you see the bird search and you go back, but the next time they come and you say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they take advantage of them and kill our livestock.
One night I was looking at the Stall. I was walking around with a tapelch in the hand, and this time the lions didn't catch up.
Bees are scared of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy, and I even took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day, she almost took me around. But I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a right-to-shelf drive plant from a motorcycle, and that shows if you want to turn to the right or left. It's blinking.
And I turned a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights.
This is a little pear from a broken flop lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar elephant is actually putting the battery, which provides electricity to the correct plant. I call it a transneurator.
And the right action is blinking.
You can see that the pearls are pointing out from the outside, because they come from there to the lions.
And so this is what the lion looks like when they come.
The lights are flashing, and the lions think I'm going around the rub, and that's where I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been on our home with this, and since then, we've never had any problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea now is used in all Kenya, including other predators, like hyena, or leopard, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and helps to engage with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we put the lights back, where there's no one left, and I'm going to show the people how to use it.
A year ago, I only took a boy from the savanna who was cudding his father's cows. I looked at planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of the day!"
And here I am.
I was invited to draw a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to wear, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, we can do this together, on the side of the lion, with the lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means this: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical innovations.
What's the next thing on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electrical fence. A electroence electroz fence?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, you've done it, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've been back to the trial because I got a blow.
All of the time, Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to be fired in every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now, since I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and no one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way to shoot a picture, not even the lighting was being explored.
To be honest, most of them were shot by randomly unluded tourists.
My story started when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I gave my daughter to my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
And so just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on --
When my wife's third birthday came up with me, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina in New York, and do it a father-in-law to lead the ritual to continue?"
At the time, we started asking dozens of tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a complete stranger and you're going to have your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been touched with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a previous moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us for a week in October, to stop the time and change our time and how we change from year to year, not only physically, but in particular, to reflect.
Because while we do the same picture, our perspective of time changes, as it always reaches new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything and how they see.
This very intense time we spend is something that we value and expect every year.
So, just recently, as one of our travel, we went for a walk, and suddenly they would be as reactive, and it shows up on a red mark on a larwagen's box that they had learned as a little child, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old at the exact same point.
She said that she remembers her heart bursting out of the chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York because she's really interested in studying in New York.
And I realized, the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like in you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not too much of a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with this image and don't you want to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
