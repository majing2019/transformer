When I was 11, I was shocked one morning by the sounds of the sounds of the thumb.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy about what was rather unusual at the time, because the news was mostly depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'm not going to forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
So I was married for five years, and I was inspired by my older sister who was not allowed to go to a secret school.
We could only go to school and go to school.
We took another way every day so nobody could guess where we went.
We're hidden our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to go shopping.
We were done in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the class had to go back to the classroom, and suddenly after a week, because the Taliban had to laugh.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
Are they advised us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we were still trying to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued and daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province in Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- send my mom to school and was rejected by his father.
But my mother was trained, but she was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received a school.
And it was always clear that his children would get an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I know that in the years of the Taliban, I sometimes remember so frustrated about our lives, of course, of the constant fear and the perspective of mindlessness.
I was very good, to give up. But my father said, "Toy, Dad, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can dial your money. You can be displaced from your house in war.
But one thing will always remain you: what's inside of this. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we'll do that.
So -- you want to give up still?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have had a higher degree than the junary degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly Jewish Jewish of the Worldbury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he was told to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who was interested in me.
He's not just about the degree of college, but also because I was the first woman and I'm the one who's driving him through the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've helped to start the SOLA, the first and perhaps only internary for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school teachers are still riskier.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school want to see the great ambition to make all of them feel the most valued chances.
And to see how their parents and fathers stand for them, as well as my parents then, despite all the other and against the worse.
Like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the way home from SOLA to her village, and they were dead through a bomb on the street just a few minutes.
When he got to his home, the phone rang and a voice attacked him if he sent his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "So now, if you want, I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old-fashioned and over-towning imagination."
What I've learned about Afghanistan, which is often not appreciated in the West: From most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that her success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't really mean to play important role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are highly ordered and convincing for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And under the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pressing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears, from America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not over and over-time and changing everything in the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents, who are using them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unfinished possibility, and I remember the girl every day, the SOLA.
They're just like me, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, including a profession -- my life was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the projects of engineering with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years ago that we're more traditional, we're brilliant people, and we're very good at working in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we took.
Our first project, which is my first book inspired by Ripples at the Zambezi, was one where we used to show the man of Muslims in Italy, how to raise food.
We came up with Italian seed in South America, in this shaggy valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local citizens to train the Asian tomatoatoes and to Anchini and ...
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed to be surprised that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't hire anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
The only time in time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these glorious tomatoatoes. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we told the Sambers, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, about 200 nilers from the river came out and they were graded and they were all over the road.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the nilperper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I thought, we were just so great as Italian, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French people did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We used to put on the nilperperders at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we haven't called the world's never-intived African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by the Intercoisa Moyo, she's a dibishian economist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read your book.
So think about a African woman, what we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root, which means "pater," which means "bater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as though they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronishening: I treat every other culture as though they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "brust," the boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "modall" by singing. He said, especially in the economic development, when people don't want to help, they leave it.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, he opened a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocococolitan?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I created a system called business fund, where never was being started, nobody is ever motivated to be motivated, but you're going to be forced to be the local courage, the local talent, the local people, the dream, to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit with a local local.
We're not working from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipes.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're closing friends and finding out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can teach someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this trap: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have a community of entrepreneurs, and they will never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunity.
You know, planning has this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We're working on one to do this, we've got to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
There's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's house manager, the hospital of the company, who's sitting in the house with you, with your kitchen table and the cafe, helps you find the tools, to help you to change your passion in a way of changing your life.
I tried this in vitileity, West Australia,
I tweaked at the time, and I tried to escape the clamels, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking through the streets in the first year, and I had my first three days of customers. I helped him. He brought fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped to sell him to a restaurant in Perth and organize, and then the fishermen came, and said, "You've helped the Mai. Can you help us help us?"
I helped these five fishermen work together, and I couldn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million dollars, but to Japan for Sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them." Can you help us?
I had 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've made it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies with the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that go through loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business leaders in history, died with 96 years ago.
And Peter press was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Cake is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest man of Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get to one.
You have to offer them disclosion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
We get 200 customers in a community of 10,000 people.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
What's most cheated by the talk that you most enjoy tomorrow?
"Sear, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the fictional fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The rebel species of preservation is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, and we can transport, and we can correspond to them.
Technology doesn't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? Forget it.
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculated, which would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was a myth: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, when the population grows on this pace, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get done with the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd go down in the crap.
In 1865, they see the dirty technology that's eating life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the backside of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered disclosion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to provide them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest and the biggest company, everybody has to be able to perform three things: to sell the brand new product, to be brilliant, to be the capital market, and to be a massive career.
So guess what?
We never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
This is not something that doesn't exist.
This person was never born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iystic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Winghouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one thing that was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in North Korea entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them the class to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Nationalography, and the job of the 16-year-old is to support two sides of Richard Bransons Nationalography, as often as he uses the word "a" and how often we use the word "weens."
Never "I" and 32 times we are.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody started it.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small professional background, and we have a cafe and Bars. You have a committed buddy who are going to do what someone who did for this gentleman talking about this vague. Somebody will say to you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate organization to help them find the tools and people, and we found out that the miracles of the local population can change culture and the economy of that community, just by understanding the passion and the power and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago about how it should be, that Alice has to be in the miracle of the country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- to give engineers education into communication.
I was scared --
Fear. Fear. For those students, with their large brains and their large books and their large, I don't trust people.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she went down to the brain of the pig cancer, and a door saw a whole new world.
And so I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed to the thought they had, and I wanted others to discover this miracle country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, such as energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to be progress. I think it's in our responsibility as a non- scientist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to come up with their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you some of the ways that you can hire, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, is it?
It tells us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
It's not just telling us that their clothes are looking at, but it's also telling us that their clothes, the plastic structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat and treat it.
And when you describe what you're doing, then you're all talking about useless dictionaries.
The dictionaries are a barrier to understand your mind.
Sure, you could use your tidy and time and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more intuitive for us?
So we're going to be thinking about it, not the same thing as they're going to shrink down their level.
As Einstein said, "To make things as easy as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably talk about your scientific area without having to deal with any compromise.
Some things about this is: examples, stories and analogies. So that's how you can pull us into your boss.
And when you show your work, let's take the spots off.
Have you ever asked why it's called "rerererererere point?"
What happens when someone else is being stabged, and with those dots, the first dots you're going to meet.
I'm talking about this, not only boring, but also also also very much about the talkalating part of our brain, and by doing so, we're quickly challenged.
This is an example of Geneber Brown that's much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, playful sentence where the audience, once it's going to lose the thread, it's controlling images and graphics that are also asking our other senses and it creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up those towers and see the wonders of the country that compelled science and technology.
And because the engineers that I've taught, I've been taught to connect with the <unk>Nield in me" in a tight, I want to sum up all the things with a equation.
So if you look at your science and your literature, you're going to divide through the relevance, so the audience says what's important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work, and that's what you're doing, and that's creating unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So engineers and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really looking for myself.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a cell phone with a drug that's known to human beings in Syria.
You can tweet a phone with a phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a phone with a phone, you can get a song, you can upload it on sound club and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a turn in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city in that time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of Germany, and we imagine that all of these people who came up and asked change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
That's 35.830 lines are all about information.
Data data.
And why are the information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.S. Go-up has signed a policy line.
This rule is called a policy policy for the protection of the law enforcement.
This rule says that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service director in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who's going to send who a email?
Who is sending a text message?
And when you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, two years from your phone company or your Internet service provider.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and they said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this administrative defenses.
We want self-driving in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were streaming around the streets of Berlin and saying, "Don't worry."
And even some people said that might be going to Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Limpolizeizeizeisti in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is that really work?
Can those things really store about us?
Every time I use my cell phone,
So I asked my phone company, the German Telecommunator, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, I ask them, I ask them, I'm going to send all the information that saved you about me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get a right answer. Just a smaller blue Blaa.
But then I told myself, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening with it.
So I decided to put a court trial against them because I wanted to have this information.
But the German translator said no, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it was about a comparison with them.
I'm going to go back to the test, and I'm going to send them all the things that they were going to send me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court court court decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was a German correct violation.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD, that was this.
35830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a giant file. I'm moving.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to publish them.
Because I want to show people what is called the administrative defenseship.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I'm doing.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to K<unk>nn, and how many calls I'm going to walk.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking to each other a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call them to each other.
And after a while, you call you and you call you, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central characters, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is talking to you, who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe, to two years.
As I first said, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of Germany had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leader was, that might have never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall wouldn't have happened.
And again, the case of the iron curtain, not the case of the temple.
Because today's government agencies and companies want to store so many information, as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every day.
So when you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you're going to tell your bosses, just because companies and government places have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they've stored on you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the visceral criminal store, the speed restaurants, the Brakak spaces.
So the city plan starts to meet and thought about changing the name of South Central so that he thinks he's going to be different, she changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes in the city, what's wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
They were locals, they were building, they were rapid restaurants, they're building spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Central Port Los Angeles, the home of the Drivehrus and the Drivebys.
The comic is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the remote conditions.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it was at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't get that anymore.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you see the negative effects that the existing food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been hoping that the skier is bought and sold like a transport park.
I see dialogue centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what we have to stop.
I realized the problem is the solution.
The problem is food and food is the solution.
And I didn't like to have a joke for 45 minutes of email to get an apple that's not mediated by pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's 45 feet at three feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started planting my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-performance group, composed of gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, it's completely voluntary and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically shared me a preload, and said that I had to remove my garden, the carrier was becoming a passion for a cheer.
And I thought, "Okay, right?
Give a narrative about how to grow food in a piece of land that you're totally not?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her Her Herft."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and talked to the city bank and a member of Green Ground. They signed a petition to Ch.org, and we succeeded with 900 regulations.
We held the victory in their hands.
My townmate even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. In the United States, most of the palms in the property of the city.
They have 600 kilometers in the metal spaces.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoatoes.
Why the hell should not find that okay?
You can get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds through the crop.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my lunch message, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I tend to be part of these preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I made my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti. I'm going to plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, a curtain wall, I'm going to try to wipe lawns and sewage.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees, are my favorite thing to do with this stuff.
You'd be surprised by what the ground is capable of using it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the soil.
They would wonder how children are influenced by it.
Sorters are the most therapeutic and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get more strawberry ones.
I remember that time, when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked at them like this.
I really felt bad, because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason in the street."
I was shocked when I watched people who were so close and hungry, and that just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye, no, I'm afraid they're squeaks.
It's the one that's on the street.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless home in the Midwest, in Downtown.A.
These are the guys that helped me to upload the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green grasslings have already planted about 20 gardens.
So to our species of species, 50 people came along and did it, and these are all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon, they eat coal.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoatoes.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they're not shown to how food and body affects food, they're blind, they're all about to eat whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and they don't go anywhere.
I see the gardeners as a chance of training these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And when we do, who knows?
We could bring the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a residential residential residential area where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship carts and turn them into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails, because free is not sustainable.
The dialogue of sustainability is that you have to resist it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them enjoy the joy, the pride and the honor, when you build your own food, and when you open up farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become the ecological rebels, the gangster, the gangiest gardener.
We have to turn the picture of the ganglight.
You're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to be a dog with a carpet, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
When you want to meet me, don't call me when you want to sit in smart chairs and make a meeting where you talk about making some jokes.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, in my garden so we can plant any flush.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollyveoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
Andnnnnnnjoster means "the unethious politicians."
Although a newspaper host gave a better definition: "A Snollyjoster is someone who is planning a office, independent of side, program or program, and his success by the pure power of the aristocratic excellence."
I have no idea what a toy is.
Some words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, the British Parliament were sent to the news collection, the same word "written" of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who had been talking to the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they tweak it, but he was courageous enough, he was courageous enough to pray, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so strong as Brass." Many believe.
It's all about the English word for the wheel.
But that's not true. It's about a convicted authorities on the press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you with the U.S. time they've just reached independence.
And you saw the question about how to call George Washington, the head of the head.
They didn't know.
What's called the leader of a universal nation?
It's been discussed for a long time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of things that were possible for computational suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him governor Washington, and others, his seniority of George Washington, and again, the other people's freedom of freedom, the government of America's State of Washington.
That's not how attractive.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought it's a good thing to do.
They weren't monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this, because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the book of a senator who is always writing, "Tell the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the long-term was the person who was the demographic house against the Senate.
The representatives of the house didn't want Washington to be seductive. They didn't want to.
King might call it, and maybe it could also bring it to ideas about it, to his after it.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most crippled titles that they thought they were.
This title was "Pemberor."
President, they didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that someone was signing a gathering.
Like a preception of a jury.
He had no longer the size than the term "wart" or "talking."
Sometimes there were little civilians who had small conflict groups and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
That's why the Senate refused to him.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to sign up and meet foreign people.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, you're going to think of the word "Sountity," but they were absolutely trying to make sure that they were not agreed for their honest respect for the opinions and practices of civil citizens, whether it's in the Republic of Monarchy, where it's the office of the state of Honely respected, not necessarily the president of the nations, and the president of the nations.
You can learn three interesting things about it.
First of all, and I think that's best -- until now, I can't find out whether the Senate ever has been officially validated the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he just loved the title. He just waits it to the Senate.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something temporary is -- -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of America's presiders today is not so humbling, right?
That's something more than 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
The story and story have given the title of size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the sound of mind -- well, it was that way back then.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost because no one feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'm going to leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually words change much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came up in a truck with about 50 rebellors at the fight with Mralalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would love my black Concertic shoes against a pair of brown leather and feathers to shoot a rocket in the direction of the government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
Before I was big, I was raised with war, but next to Pyjama parties and football talks at Samens and commits with the racist South African and Muslim protesters who had never known to travel with communism and Afghanistan for a long time, and to decide what I knew was.
But this is the geography of the self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing here, I'm a man-made Afghane, I'm a Western-stath of God's Republic, an atheist, and a radical political artist who's been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan, and created.
So in Afghanistan, there's a lot of great things that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainbows. I want to make art that draws people together and challenge and characterize and rewriting reality and rewriting reality and even some kind of sophisticated people to try and understand the world that we're living in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- a jihad teacher who is doing jihad against the community as "Pople" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad strike do when the parliament is going to do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I calling me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to allow these Mafitiosi who are spending as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, and I want to go to a project called "Rape," where you give yourself a policeman, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and drive cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money, and in the name of Kabul, and in the police department, and I hope that they will take us the 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the "Citiial conflict."
The war and the stranger who came to him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I would train local local indigenous peoples with a shelter or a bunch of recycled in a neo-autuous, Portuguese.
And I'd like to see what a simple pock from Kabul might look like between 18999999 to create a dialogue about the current development organization that its origins in the past colonial rhetoric have about the "The White Man" to protect the brown man in itself and maybe even a little bit of a civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, you can misunderstood them, misrepresented them.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, just so many people said.
I felt like I've built a uncomfortable tension here in the room, because I shouldn't have been attached to this dress.
I'm lucky to have something to change.
This is the first time someone meditates at the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happy ones to see this.
If some women were really cheating when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read it to Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
Nobody has any chance to do that.
These tracks are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater above my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so you're not doing anything, as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it's not, hopefully, as awkward as this picture.
And a picture of the brain is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should use my back oil and put my hand in my hand with my hand in the hair of this guy.
And beyond the surgery or the wrong thing that I've been trying to do two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterances, and the expressions of our utterances, even though it's superficial and ineffective -- a large impact on our lives.
Being too uncomfortable is to be honest for me today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my industry we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is the legacy?
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical in the history of admiration that we're biologically programmed but also as big, sharp, feminist and brighter.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was given for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some fashion concerts might say, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smalls. Liu."
And first of all, I'm talking about your model fiction. Very impressive.
But I'm afraid to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, everybody was counted on the length of the day, every single one that was being executed, and that 67773 modules were only 27 or less than four percent of them.
The next question that's always asked me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown up?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is this little girl, why?
You know what? You can all be anything.
You can become president of the U.S. or the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja psychiatric expert, which would be completely wrong, because you're the first one."
And if you're still talking about this amazing translation, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of the American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
And to say that you want to be a model later, that's like saying you're going to get the Jack 101 in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I'd like to show you 10 years of a newborn model of knowledge, because it can only escape from heart surgeons.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run." So now the leg goes first, and it goes up, and that arm goes back, and the back to the back, you're on the hand, and you just move back, and you just look back, and you're going to see, like, 300 friends, and you're going to
And it looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened there.
If you finish school and have a life and you've done some jobs, you can't say much, because if you say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to be a doctor in your life, and you're going to be looking at 10 years of underwear.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is going to release all the photos?"
And yes, so much of all the photos are being cleaned, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the very first photo I've done, and that's also the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the book.
My girlfriend had to come up with me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a few days before a Shacket for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the New Yorker magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructed, and they're designed by a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeupists and photographers and Stylists and Stylists and all their assistants and the evaluation and the evaluation. They're not me.
Okay, next question, people always ask me, "What do you do for free?"
Yes, I have too many, many 20-cent-match shoes that I can never wear except just except, but the things that I get free are things that I get to get in real life and talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I forgot my money, and I gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was left with a red light, and of course we were stopped. It just took you, "Excuse me, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, and we could go on.
I got these costless things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality to a high price.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and filtered last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
In New York, only 17,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I listening?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to stop?"
So I found out that research, and I found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent if they were 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thin and shiny hair, you feel very happy and fulfilled."
And then we give back days a response that might be surprised by this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
It's all true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never tell from the camera, which I never said before in front of the camera, is, "I feel insecure."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had little legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest clothes, and they're probably the nature of their appearance of the most insecure women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to get me to get a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable with this one, to put myself up and say, "I've got all the benefits of a pile that was being mixed up in my throat." And it doesn't feel very good to say, "And that's not always going to make me happy."
It was very difficult to open up a legacy of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the biggest users.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've managed here before 10 or 20 years of last, and my career has passed out, because I'd probably not say how I was going to get my first job, or I'd not say, like, I've been paid to tell you how I was paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our failed successes and misconceptions rather.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who's been in exile about life: "Son, gay Gaddafi's resistance. Give him a fight.
But I'm never going to be like a Gaddafi revolution."
There's almost two years since the Libyan revolution, inspired by the waves of mass mass mass performance in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I teamed up with many other Libyers, and outside of Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gadadis.
And it was there, a big revolution.
Young, Lebanby women and men stood in the first row, asked the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice to the air.
They proved some prince by asking for the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the east to the far west, to the South.
After a period of six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and to eradicate the tyranny.
Gaddafi left a great warrior, a legacy of tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the process of the process.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has suppressed tyrannic regimes and the infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the supernatural society.
The destruction and the challenges, I renamed as many other women to build the civil society of Lyianania. We asked a participatory and fairer to democracy and nationalized.
Nearly 200 organizations were founded, and immediately after Gaddafis founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and I started working together with unique enthusiasm, and I started workinghops to organize the issues of human development and leadership skills.
So with a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform with Danyters, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to engage in public health, to engage in the societic empowerment of women, and to our right to the right-being of democracy and of democracy.
I met a very difficult environment in the elections, a community that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish political politics and determination.
I led a initiative to the Peace Movement of Liberyberians to achieve a participatory choice, a law that anyone, any citizen, whatever background, should vote the right and vote for, and most importantly, to establish a political parties between a female and a Russian and a Russian and a common and amendments to make a decision.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successfully.
Women won 175 percent of the nationwide lawyer in the first elections since 52 years.
But it was very clear, but the euphority of elections and the entire revolution after the whole revolution, because every day we were making new news about violence.
We were told a morning about the ban about the ancient mosques and the Sufi masters.
And on a different morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, again, another morning, the victim of the army was signed by the victims.
And really every day, we were facing the tyranny of the military and the challenges against the human race, prisoners and their dissonance of laws and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles of politics, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had initially stopped.
Intatiness, and rebellion and Rue became the icons of the Folian era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our failed and the elections.
In fact, I'm here to suggest that we, as a nation, have made false choices and the wrong choices.
We've misbehaked our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or stability or safety in Lybans.
Have the ability to make the case and the change between women and men and women's candidates and national reconciliation?
No, it's not.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and of opposition, both men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing that missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the confession.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus when it took the elections, which ultimately strengthens the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the woman more than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and challenge a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't just value, but also to confuse: Goffade instead of revenge, cooperation, instead of competition, rather than unfinished.
These are the ideals that need one of the rapted leybans desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemie, and in those alchemia, it's about the causal of feminine and masking viewpoint.
That's the real truth-tist.
And we have to do that in particular, before we do it societic.
After a writer from the Koran, "Salam," "Fith the word of the Good God, rall."
The word "radhe" again, which is known in all the late-raam traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "ra" and symbolized "em" and symbolizes the mother's mother of feminine, the whole man of humanity, the man and the female and the female, and all the peoples and all have been upset.
And just like the mother's assors that grows in him, completely around him, so the basic body of compassion is the whole existence.
So we're told, "My Gnade is all things that are going to lead."
So we were told, "My Gnade has preedcted before my Groll."
Let's all get the art of the gistade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we took the story of Kim Illung, but we didn't learn very much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although often I was wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all of a change.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me, from a colleague of mine.
And it said, "If you were laughing at this, our five family members will not be on the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
So I went through the trainway and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
There was a blind woman on the ground, and a drowned child in her arm just shook helplessly in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were so busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were sick of famine, and many others survived because they ate grass and beetles and tree cortex.
So traffic accidents are getting more and more common, so at night, it's all about me, except the lights of China on the other side of the user that we've lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite view of North Korea and his neighbor at night.
This is the river of Amad, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you see, the river can be very, very narrowed, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
I sometimes saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to China.
I just thought I would be separated from my family for a short time.
I would have never thought it takes 14 years to come back and live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be as the North Bronx refugee, but I realized soon that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Bronx refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and was given to the police department.
Somebody told me that I was a Northstorean teacher, so they tested my Chinese stories, and they gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought I would explode my heart.
So that's not that it's not that it's going to seem like that that you're being a chance of being a case of rational, that you're not that you're going to be a chance of being a case of being a case of mind that you're not that I'm going to be So that I'm being So that I'm being So that I'm not know that I'm sure that I'm not know that
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they were done with the questions, a lawyer said to the other, "That was a false failure.
It's not a Northstoreier."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are getting caught in China in foreign messages likeyl, but many are caught by the Chinese police and signed up.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they eventually released out because of immense international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China being caught and signed up to North Korea, where they were tortured, imprisoned or publicly.
Although I was lucky, I was lucky, so many other North Koreans don't.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After they've learned a new language and found a work, the world can be reacted in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
I was a greater challenge in South Korea than I thought I had thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And of course, I've seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very diverged by a series of layers, because of 67 years of division.
I was through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstorean?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation that I'm not feeling easy about the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was interested in the recording of the university.
Just when I was born on my new life, I got a shocking call.
The North Bronx government started to take the money that I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to resign, to a remote place on the country.
They had to escape as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to leave an incredible track on their way to liberty.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took myself to the north-dath border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, to over 2,000 miles through China, and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we were almost more caught.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the outings of all, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I agreed, and he told him they were gay, and I was her boss.
He looked at me, but luckily he believed me.
We managed to get to the lavic border, but I had to almost look at all my money to bribe the border routes of Laos.
But even after we passed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border borders.
After I had paid money and bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest disadvations of my life.
I had done everything to keep my family out of freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested, just before the Southern Korean Embassy.
I went and I went to the foreign agency and the police department, and I tried to desperately liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay for money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice asked me the man, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised to think that there was a stranger about it.
I was able to write my situation in a broken English and a dictionary, and I was able to tell my situation, and he was going to go to a bank machine, and he paid the money for my family and pay two other North Koreans to get them out of prison.
And I thank him about the heart, and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I will help the North Bronx people."
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The stranger who's previously symbolized me to be a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
After our long journey, my family and I were again in Southern Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us in education, to learn English, to the education and to do so many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would want to challenge the hopeful North Koreans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just one request today.
Please don't ask me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very well-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers might not be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it unconditional, and he divided it away.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to say, not even when I remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
He's 16. He's big. He's very good at looking at him.
It has absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate cake, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, talking about when he was four, while the first result of the teapbaties on my arm and Lady Gagas.
Don't listen to it incredibly?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't match the social version of normal, they often have been over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged and my soul empowered was that although this was the case, although they were not considered common as usual, that could only mean one, that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that influenced social communication, learning and physical abilities.
It's a different part of every individual, and that's why Remi is so different from Sam.
And it's going to be noticed every 20 minutes in a new person with autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing organisms in the world, there's no known cause or healing.
And I can't remember the first time I'm confronted with autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized he was different.
He was very afraid of him.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and he didn't seem to be very interested in me.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space that would fill the washing machine and eat everything that came out of him.
And as he became older, he became different and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustles and the never-dominated hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any bias, a human who never had otherwise been lied.
Remarkably remarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they taught me about individuality and communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to interact against normality.
You know, normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be not like you're normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! We all have a gift in each of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edonte has filled us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of a apple, and with a mass destruction of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femtoto-Aid photography, a new technology that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light into motion.
And so we can build cameras that can look out at corners of our view or can't see a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we mean with "mamera"
Now, if I take a laser back and I light it in a billionth of a second -- this is several Femtoseconds -- I make a package of photons that hardly a vertical, and this photon package of this project, this project will move in speed, and I said, "How do you do a million times faster than a product."
So if you take this project, this photon pack pack and you put it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in time motion?
So this whole event, this --
So think about it, the entire event actually takes less than a nanototone -- so long as the light needs to get back this track -- but I'm going to try to highlight this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So this film is going to happen a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photons package that starts moving through and that eventually breaks inside.
Some of the light is flowing out on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
And eventually, a lot of the photons eventually get to the detergent of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that's going to hang around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves spread on the table, and because of the reflection from the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
So if you take a common project and leave it back the same track, and you slow that video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
Day a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what does it look like with something still-time photography?
You can see again, like these waves on the table, the Tomces and the wall flattened across the back of the back.
It's like throwing a rock in a pond.
It seemed like nature was painting a photo like this, a Femto-A image, but of course our eye is a collection of a collection.
But if you look at this Tomces again, you'll notice that when the light is going to push the Tomva, it's not going to keep that dark.
Why is that? Because the Tombrate is turned up and the light jumps around you, and after a few billion seconds, it comes back.
So in the future, if this taptoto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find out if a fruit is closed, without touching it at all.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're going to take a picture with a short-term of energy, you have very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your shortest energy time, so you're not getting as good as any light at all.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons package, a million times, and we're drawing this again with very clever synchronization and we're combining these gigabytes of data, and we're going to make these Rovers and we've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes: To see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn some light on the door.
It's going to be clipped down, go into the room, some of it's bounced back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we can use these more magnifying trajectories of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
Behind the wall is hidden, and we're going to have the lights on the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications Center, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to break this light project, and they're going to push it up to that wall, and this photons package is all over the way, and some of the photons will get our hidden soup that will break our hidden cloth, and then the door will reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny fraction of the photons back to the camera, but they'll all be slightly interesting at the time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-consuming, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the ones that hide the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by taking a laser light, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take lots of these pictures, dozens of these pictures, and we put them together and try to analyze the different light-controlled textures, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We have a little bit to do before we can do this from the lab, we could build cars that are out of the collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous fires by looking for the lights, looking through the open windows, or we can build endcopes that are going to see deep around the body and see them in Ok Kubecrosque.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, so this is really a game call for scientists, now thinking about Femto-Aid photography, because a new visualization process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edaturon, even a scientist, science has become a art, a art of ultra-grapt photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collected every time, not only the scientific process. We can create a new form of computer photography, and we can look at color-t just look at the wave between us, and we can look at all the time behind the waves and remind us.
But it also happens to something funny.
If you look at those waves under the bottleneck, you see the waves moving away from us.
The waves should be to move to us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we're almost in light speed, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
The order that happens in events in the world is appearing in the camera, in a second order, by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, I don't care whether it's time for photography, whether it's about the creation of a new visualization for medicine or new exhibitions, since we've made all the data and details on our website, and hope that the "Sership maker," the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop to start to start on the megixixixels, and we should start to start to start to start the next database of the camera and
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that a lot of wisdom is not being passed, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like a pair of tiny, gerons and crosses and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying with each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for sustained homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the giant oats that have been cured for hundreds of years, gay, drunk and inertian shadows. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone ever thinks there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most abandoned possessions in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I can make it, and so I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I was thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity of the things that I'm interested in in in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned a side of the abandoned house into a giant board and I wrote with a collection of the gaps: "Tell me I die, I want to die," I want everybody to take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely filled and it grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"Tell I'm mortal, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Tell I die, I want to stand across the International Data line."
"Tell I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Only I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Tell I'm mortal, I want to live "weard-weet."
I wish I'd die, I want to keep it back to my arms."
"Tell I'm mortal, I want to be somebody with a cavallery."
"Tell I die, I want to be myself."
This is a place that was neglected to a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people, brought me to laugh, to the wine and to enjoy me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding that they're in a new and urgent way.
It's about creating space forge and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction kit, and now worldwide in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of overweight distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often judged to talk about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation to death is one of the things that strengthen us.
So the idea of death is that it tells us life.
We're most interested in our common spaces, which is important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people around us can not only help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in working with more sophisticated mathematics. I'm a special problem for everybody who is involved in more motivated mathematics is that we're like business leaders.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain to you today what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the painting of the master-reading ballet and the feathers, as you'll see.
So the ballett is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental proposition that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It's also what I've done with my fellow people who had been interviewed Janriides, who was a ballet surgeon.
Over the years, we've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unfamiliar symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, pearility and others living with this disease, so we need objective tools to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer that question.
The trouble is that there's no biomarkional activity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's available to this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical trials, it's never done. It's never done.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't take a healthy hospital staff.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to look at the neurologic department.
So I want to propose to you a unconventional method that we try to do that, because we're all of us, in some sense, virtual, like my fellow Janulations.
You see a video of the vibrant vocal lobe.
This is what happens in the healthy condition when someone is creating speech sounds, we can look at ourselves as a coherent ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we create clones, and we all have genes for it. FoxP.
And like Ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until learning it.
And by the way that sound, we can determine the position of the vibrant vocal lobe, and like the limbs, the limbs are also affected by the vocal muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the irregular vocal information that you can see.
We see the same symptoms always.
True, weakness, hipthiness.
The language will even be more mature and fuzzy, and that's an example of theymptom.
And this impacts can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision analysis software, combined with new machine engineers that are now advanced, we can now predict where someone is in a space between illness and health, just because of the vocal sounds.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
Not so much. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And they're exactly accurate. They're not done by experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're at 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something very cheap is cheap, you can use it in a great scale.
So we can do these amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logistics for patients.
We don't have to have to have routine plans in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do cheap mass recruitments for clinical trials, and we can first get a study of the whole population to be fully viable.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
We're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law index of the Procentment.
We want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the successive goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Everybody, or without Parkinson, can call cheaply, to leave a few cents, and I'm known to be afraid that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we say we're going to take 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell if the person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be created until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions matter, because we're wired to try to make it happen to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
It's your 86 percent accuracy right now?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown now that it's also working on the mobile network, which allows this project to do, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
So people can call -- people can call the phone and call the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
That's exactly what it is.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern border of Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows in the back of my father and the one behind the campus is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only involved in the South, which means that wildlife like zebras can leave the park anytime.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, thinks we're going to come together with our animals and our livestock to the heavens, so our animals care so much.
I was a kid to learn how to hate lions.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our Herden. They're also set up because of this problem.
and kill the lions.
This is one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's because there's just so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for his father's cows. So I was like, this is what I was talking about.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it's helping the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was going to be next to the coward.
But lions are very clever animals.
They come, they look at the bird search and they go again, but the next time they come and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they're going to reach, and they're killing our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the Stall. I was walking around with a barchel in my hand, and this time the lions didn't bat.
Beauty is fear of light, and that moves.
I had an idea. I had an idea.
Ever as a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day, she almost took me around. But I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy station from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn to the right or left. It's noisy.
And I made a switch to turn the lights and turn it off.
This is a little pearl from a broken flap lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar elephant is actually providing the battery, the battery is providing electricity to the correct system. I'm going to call it a transformator.
And the right-making system is flashing.
You see that the eggs show outwards, because they come from there, the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights and the lions believe that I'm going around the rubble, and that's when I was in bed.
Thank you.
I've been in our home with this, and since then we've had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including other predators, like hyena, or leopard, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants out of farms.
My invention helped me go to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is a social partner, and it's helping and help it with fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and we put the lights together, where there's no one there, and I'm going to show the people how to use it.
A year ago, I only had a boy from the savanna who was cooking his mom's cows. I looked at airplanes about me and I said, "I'm going to sit in a room!"
And I'm standing here.
I was invited to train a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm old, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to get a look. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions together. We can share together, page, with lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk>n. In my language, that means this: I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electric invention.
What's next to the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. A simple electroz fence?
Yes, I know, electrical panels have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, you've tried it, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've given the attempt to go back because I got -- I got a --
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you every step of your bosses, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
For the time I'm old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and not one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even had the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I gave my daughter to her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and five.
And so just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where that's going on ...
When the third birthday of my daughter came up with a little bit, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York, do a father-child race to lead the ritual?"
And then we started asking, by the time, I started asking, you know, a street tourist, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal gesture is when you're going to take a complete stranger to your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody's ever touched with our camera.
We didn't know how much those travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very holy.
This one was taken just after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a moment of a moment or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us for a week in October, keeping time and changing our time and how we're going to come to a year, not just physically, but in everything.
Because whenever we do the same picture, our perspective changes as time as it is, as it always reaches new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how it deals with everything, and how it sees.
This very intense time we spend on each other is something that we value and expect every year.
So recently, as one of our travels, we went for a walk, and suddenly they're going to go like this, it shows a red mark on a red truck on a box of a box that they had learned as a little kid, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old about this particular job.
She said she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now they look at it in New York because they want to study it in New York.
And I realized that it was obvious: The most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking a active role in the informed creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not very much of a family photograph.
I'm always the one who makes the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with this image and don't you want to ask someone, "Would you have a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.59, 56.2/32.7/20.3/12.9 (BP=0.971, ration=0.972)
