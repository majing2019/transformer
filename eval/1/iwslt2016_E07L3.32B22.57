When I was 11 years old, I was hit by the sounds of the sounds of joy.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly covering the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but my father was obviously very happy.
"Now, you can go to a right school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
I mean, a real school.
The Taliban took power in Afghanistan when I was six, and banned girls to go to school.
So I was complaining to be a boy for five years, and my older sister who had not been able to go home to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
We took another way to try and figure out where we went.
We hide our books in a car store so it looked like we'd just run.
We were put in a house, and over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a cold in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risk our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over again, the class suddenly had to go out for a week because the Taliban had been suicidal.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Did they accept us?
You know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and identified by daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign march from a foreign province of Afghanistan, and he was concerned to send his daughter -- to school, and became rejected by his father.
My native mother was a teacher.
It's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retire, just to transform our house to girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- the first one in his family ever received a school.
It was always clear that his kids would get an education, even though their daughters were going to get married, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk of sending his kids to school.
I still know that I was frustrated in the Taliban for the years, sometimes, from our lives, from the endless fear and the perspective of viewlessness.
I was very good to give up, but my father said, "Toy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be raised by your house.
But one of the things that I'm always going to remain, which is what's in here, and even if we have to pay our blood for your lunch, we'll do that.
So -- do you want to give me still?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, women have a higher degree as a professor, and if my family had not been used so much to be used for my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here as a proudly unconventant of the Middle College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was violated by his family, because he was accused of sending his daughters to school, one of the first people who was committed to me.
He's not just a secretist with my college, but also because I was the first woman who runs him through the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for education for women.
So I helped build wireless, the first, and maybe the only business bank bank for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school teacher is still risky.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school want to look at a great ambition for all of them to be able to see opportunities.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents at the time, despite the end of all the events.
So like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was out on the home of SanLA in her village, and they are from a bomb on the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the telephone rings and a voice signed him, if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
He said, "Well, now, if you want to, but I will not put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old and distractive ideas."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that's often not going to be rejected in the West: Behind most of us, a father, is a parent who recognizes the value of his daughter, and realize that it's going to be success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers are not going to play a critical role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are highly, more informed and more convincing for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men are essential.
The Taliban were only a few hundred girls in school because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, they're going to press over three million girls in the school bank.
Afghanistan is looking at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not longer and more than long-term, and more than the United States's population changes.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who use them to encourage them, I see a promising future and a long change.
Afghanistan is for me a country of hope and the unconconven possibilities, and remember me every day, the girls who go to the ROLA.
They have a big dreams like me.
Thank you.
All I do, including living -- my life was shaped by seven years in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977, I see young, but not -- I have -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria, and Somalia, projects with the engineering collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I mean, 21 years, I thought we're an Italian good person and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we measured.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples in Zam Abw, was one of the people in Italy, who wanted to show people like Sambique, how to raise food.
We came up with Italian seed in South Zambia, and in this sharp valley, which leads to Sambesi's Hospital. We trained the local population of the Asian tomatoatoes and the pistini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest about it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank you for God, we're here!"
Just in time, the people in Sambias, are still going to save the star."
Of course, it's wonderful in Africa.
We had this wild tomato. In Italy, they were so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were closed and red, about 200 nibles came out of the river and they were all faded.
We said to the Torambers, "Oh God, the nilah!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian, but I was so great at Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French world did, and after the time, I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least the nourgos.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we haven't called the unconcreated African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Damhisa Moyo, she's a post-the-the-profit scientist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing.
Just read her book.
You're reading from a African, which we've been tracking.
We are Western people, imperialists, missionists, and there are only two species we deal with people. We criticize them, or we are patriocic.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "Vather" means "sater."
But they have two different meanings.
I mean, patriarchic: I'm going to treat every other culture, as if they were my kids. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I treat every other culture than they were my coach.
So white people in Africa are called "boke," boss, call it.
I was shocked when I read the book "mall" by singing. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, let them go in quiet.
That should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
So this conference, the gentleman who opened up this conference, he set up a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that is not a neocololial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and invented a system called a company called a company that never was replicated, never will be motivated, but you will be forced to be a service of the local passion, the local talent, the local man who has a better person to be better.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you're stuck with a local home.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafes. We're putting in Kneip.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to conclude by giving friends and finding what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for its own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We're helping them find knowledge because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea has not really got knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this kind of trap: Why instead of getting into a community and saying what to people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
They never have a part of trust, and they will never say what they want to do with their money, what they're going to see for opportunities.
You have a plan to have this blink.
The smartest people who don't know the community because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We work on one to do this, needs to be made social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's been designed to be created by a new profession.
This is the houseman of the company, the hospital of the company that sits in your house with you, on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you to find the means to transform your passion to transform life.
I've tried this in the section, Western Australia, trying to do it.
I was also trying to escape the time, trying to escape the damless, where we say others what to do,
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and in the first three days, my first client, I helped him, he was a fish in a garage, he was Maii. I helped him to sell him to a restaurant and to fund, and then we came to the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped us, "You know, I've helped us, I'm going to help us, I'm going to help us, I
I helped these five fish, working together, and not selling this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents to 60 cents a company, but after Japan for 15 dollars in D<unk>K, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them, you help us? Can you help us?"
I had been walking 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I do something very, very hard.
I listen to them." I listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the creation.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisors of history died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter printer said, "Make is actually unregible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
You know, planning is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchiss, not knowing what the smartest man Christchiss is about to do with her money and her energy.
You have to learn how to get this one to get to one.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be stuck.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people who have been able to imagine intelligence and passion?
For what presentation has you been paying most blame to this morning?
Be careful people. You've been accused of it.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- un-pimate fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
It's not sustainable.
The open-fit-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-mong-the
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, transport, and allow them to turn them into a conspiracy.
The technologies are not there.
Who will create this technology for the green revolution? universities? Remember it!
The government? Remember!
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 180, they came together and they would be speculated what would happen in the city of New York City for 100 years. The conclusion was a historical: The city wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in that speed, they needed six million horses to attract people to be able to get it, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they went under the crap.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that keeps life from New York City.
What happens, 40 years later, 1900, there was 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, the race had done. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
So Deard, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, the first one has to be offered to be discourse.
They don't come. They don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to provide them absolute, committed, passionate and passionate services.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, everyone has to be able to do three things: to sell the product to be great, the market market has to be great, and the financial agency has to be massive.
So guess what?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We've done research, and we've looked at the 100 inans of the world -- Carnegie, Wdohouse, Edison, Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that has all successful companies in the world, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16 teenagearians in North Korea, and we start teaching them to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransographic Cansographic, and the task is to be able to provide the first two sides of Richard Bransographic autobiological interfaces, as often as the word "s" and often use the word "s" "s" and often.
Never "h" and 32 times "we".
It wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody did.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small entrepreneur background in cafeteria and Bars. Her loved friend who will do what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this quote. What's going to you saying.
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you think I'm going to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support companies to help them find the means of the resources and people, and we found that the wonder of the intelligence of local people can be changed, and the economy can be changed by just a passion of the passion of the importance of the importance of their imagination and their imagination.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago how it should be, Alice has to be in the miracles of the country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communication -- to give engineers to communication.
I was afraid of it.
Fear. Fear from these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, I don't trust words.
But when the conversations evolved, it was about Alice, when she was able to get down the brain of the slime mold and saw a door to a whole new world.
I felt like I was doing conversations with students. I was amazed to think about the thoughts they had, and I wanted to know that others knew that this miracle country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones who are our biggest problems, like address energy and health, and if we know nothing about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to be progress. I think it's not going to be in our responsibility as a non-concient scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to be in their miracle country.
So scientists and engineers, please, please join us.
I want to show you a few approaches, how you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy doing with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, okay, and what?
Just to tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Not only do we think that their grandchildren are examined, but also tells us that their grandchildren are studying their antennach, studying the light-like structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat the oopicists.
And when you describe what you do, the same thing that you do, the same thing is the same thing that you call.
In the same term, a barrier is a barrier to understanding your thoughts.
Certainly, you could use your "first" and time-time, but why don't you just say "h" and time," which is a lot more understandable for us?
We're not able to understand the same as they're throwing up their level.
As Einstein said, "Mait things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell something about your scientific area without having to compete with any trade.
Now, a few things are involved in this: examples, stories and analogies. So you can pull us into your booth.
And when you put your work, then take the dots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "mong point?
What happens when someone gets over? Another one is going to be taken to be weeks, and with those dots, the first one you have.
It's not just boring, but it's also very boring to talk very much about the work of our brain, and by doing that, we're going to be able to get very fast.
This example of Gene Lindber Brown is much more effective. She shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable, even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence where the audience is going to lose the thread, relying it, print images, and also to encourage our other senses to understand what it means.
So these are just a few approaches that can help us open up this door and see the wonder land that is going to engage science and technology.
Because the engineers I've taught, I've taught, to make a connection in my sleell, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
So, if you look at your science, look at your comments and your preconcussions, you will share this through your mind, which is what's important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work, and you have this idea of the potential, and it's going to be made possible interactions that are full of new insights that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was absolutely interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
You can change a cell phone, and give you a personal freedom.
You can film a cell phone, you can film a crime in humanity in Syria.
You can go to a cell phone, you can start a message and start a pollination in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, put it on soundboard and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin a year, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to this city in the time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming from and demanding and changes had a cell phone in the bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Just keep it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep them up!
Keep it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
They're a lot. Almost every one has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35830 lines full of information.
Data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Recess came up with a legal line.
This is called a policy line of governance exchange.
And the line is, every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service in Europe, needs to store a range of users's search system.
Who calls who's going to pick up? Who is sending an email?
Who is going to send a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months, two years from your telephone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to have this plan-tal supply.
We want self-esteem in the digital age, and we don't want to use the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here, you can see how tens of thousands of people were wandering out on the streets of Berlin and said, "sacility rather than fear."
And some people even said that could be going to be going to be on the Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Lwobolist in easternland.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can we really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the periodic telecommunications that was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, I would give you all the information that you've made on me.
And I asked them once, and she asked her again, and she didn't get the right answer. Just another Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that's been doing this.
So I decided to put a court trial against it because I wanted to have this information.
But the uniform Tele-mit said, no, we will not give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going back to the tag, trying to send all of the information to me.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was a German law of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown flush with a CD.
And on the CD, that was what it was.
35830 points of information.
First, I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge date. I'm sorry.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little skeptical, what do I do to start with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm asleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do them published.
Because I want to show people what is called a protective supply.
So with time, online and open data, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out and zoom out, you can go back and down.
You can take every step I do, I'm going to look for.
And you can even see how I drive by Frankfurt with the train to the train of the oil, and how many calls I do on the road.
So all of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then I'll call a couple of friends and call them each other.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You see the central characters, like who is the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design, how to monitor a society because you know who speaks to who is going to send a email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I first said, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi knew who was on the demonstration, and if the Stahah knew who the leaders had been, it would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Walls, maybe it would have occurred.
And even after that, the case of the iron wall.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and open.
You want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it all the way long.
But self-worth and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
You have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you say, just because companies and government spaces have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it for a long time.
And if you don't believe me, do you ask your phone company for information that you've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight yourself in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the same flustors, rapid restaurants, air spaces.
So the city plan is going to meet, and survived the name of South Central, so that it changes it for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
We have a window of flopping, rapid-dwelled restaurants, air spaces.
Like 26, million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, home from the Dredchus and the Drenty Beys.
The cometic is that the Drivechus kills more people than the Driveyysy.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the sacred illness.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even stand with that.
And I wondered how you would feel feeling feeling, if you didn't have access to healthy food, if you go from the house every time you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to make sure that the Rollle's handers and sell to use parking-up.
I see a conversation center of the skyshifting like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
It's food, and food is the solution.
But I didn't like to get a little bit of a little bit of a three-minute-minute-minute-daughter to get a apple that is not subjected to pesticides.
So I plant a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park park.
It's 45 feet up to three feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in the state."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Gries, and we started planting my food heat, and plant trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a professional group, combined by all the social layers and from all the city, it's completely free, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically set me a station, and he said that I have to go out of my garden, the carrier was a confession of a competency.
And I thought, "Yeah, go on, right?
They're not quite a compartmentalizing by growing food from a site that you're completely not true?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because it wouldn't be going to go.
The L.A. Times got wind from this. Steve Lopez, and he was talking about a story about it, and a member of Green Ground Zero, and she calculated a petition on Chays.org, and we had been successful with 900 regulations.
We stopped the victory in the hands.
I even called my city, and said they support it, and love what we do.
So, why not do they do that?
LA. There's the most room in the United States in the community in the middle of the city.
They own 25,000 kilometers in the palm.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why would it not be that they should not find okay?
You get 1,000 seeds from the growing plant, you get 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my name of my name, I say that they should be feeding their own food.
They're like to print their own food, like their own money.
See, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I was more confident to be part of this unconceptual reality that was made by other people, and I've been able to make my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti working. I'm going to make my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been cursing walls, I'm going to break lawn and park spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my closest to this stuff.
You'd be surprised what the ground floor can do, if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunblower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You would wonder how kids are influenced by it.
and the most delicate act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get strawberry straws.
I remember this time when this mother came and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in my backyard, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
It's not the way to the road."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just influenced me to do this. People asked me, "Foney, you have no fear that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid that she's going to make a look.
It's a place on the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back to your health."
I put a garden in this homeless garden in D.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the truck in the front of the car.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced her, and how she's influenced her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even for a moment.
And so, the top of the sunshine has already planted about 20 gardens.
And we found that we had these 50 people, and they did all the volunteers.
When kids eat carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoatoes, they eat jellyfish.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they're not shown how food and bodies are going to be blind, they're always going to eat whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see color-like kids who are just on the path that was being looked at them, and they're not going to go anywhere.
I see the garden garden garden as a chance where we can train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential block where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take a shipboard and turn it into healthy cafe.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails because free is not sustainable.
It's a myth of sustainability that you have to keep it through.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and honor and honorful, when you build your own food, and if you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to be the external rebels, the gang, the gang-hirts.
We need to turn the image of the cliffs.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a little bit of a geek, clear?
And let's be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me when you want to sit in the fry chairs and want to sit a meeting where you talk to somebody else.
If you want to meet me, you come with your shirt, you can put some of the chairs in my backyard so that we can plant any of these.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the Oxford English dictionary is "nnnnnnolly Monology."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nnnnolly Monaster" means "natural politicians."
Although a newspaper writer was a better definition: "A Snollyyner is someone who is a office, independent, or program, or successing its success through the aerodynamic determination of the existential determination."
I have no idea what's called a toy name.
I think, in other words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, the British Parliament were not going to be able to miss the exact word "writy" of the debut.
And that was actually going back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brassrosby, who had been tracking with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and we gave him a look, but he was courageous enough to stop, and finally he had so much support in London.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so strong as Brass." Many believe.
And the word is, you know, the way you can see, the Internet is a little bit of a stick.
But it's not true. It's going back to a pollary officer's press of freedom.
But to show you how words are interrupted and politics, I want to take you with the United States, at the time when they've just reached independence.
You'd be looking for the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
I didn't know.
How do you call the leader a universal nation?
It was been reported in Congress for infinite long-term arguments.
And there were all sorts of possible ideas.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the other, the freedom of the United States of Washington.
Not so much more sensitive.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's going to be approved.
They were not monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific period.
It could have been able to work.
But everyone was not bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the days of a writer who is always writing, "I'm still going to have the same topic."
The reason for the waist was the long-term, bored that the demographic house was against the Senate.
I didn't want to want Washington to be a good thing. They didn't want to do it.
King calls it, and maybe give it to ideas about its own.
They wanted to give him the most obvious, most vulnerable, most of the most common title that they thought.
This is a title.
President didn't invent the title. It just meant that someone was a gathering of a meeting.
It's like a preference of a jury.
He had no longer size than the term "wart" or "woof."
Sometimes there were a handful of black protesters and government groups, but it was really a unconven title.
That's why the Senate refused to get rid of it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to be signed and meet foreign carriers.
Who's going to take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of America's United States?
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
Instead, the word "The name is to use the word "sirist" but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not agreed to be honest for the opinions of humanity and institutions, whether it's a monarchy where the state of the state of the state of the state of the state, it's not necessarily the most respected, and the other people who are not necessarily responsible to be the president of the United States,
You can learn three interesting things.
First -- and I find the best thing -- until now, I have no idea whether the Senate ever confirmed the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he just got the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says something temporary -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of America's name is not so scary, right?
That has something to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic swarms that he has, and the largest economy of the world, and a flap of drones, and this whole thing.
And reality and story has given the size.
And so the Senate won the end.
You get a respectary title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the counter-pirability -- now it was that it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
Four.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear fighters and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative house, because nobody feels very humbling when one said, you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'll give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a moment.
We need politicians to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change reality a lot more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 engines to fight the Stalalabad -- a 12-year-old, vegetarian concert of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to wake up my black-graders against a pair of brown leather and swipped a rocket in the outside of the government, which I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I've been big with war, but next to Pyjama party and football and commutors, and commute with a racist South-American and Islamic protesters, the no one who's been working with the communism and lived with Afghanistan, and lived in Afghanistan, and I knew what I knew before the previous events were.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, I'm now, a mangrown, South African-state, from God Gnn, and a radical political artist who's been working last nine years in Afghanistan, and worked.
So, there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rains. I want to make art that compelled people to connect and to express the reality and re-cite reality and somehow use a kind of a kind of preconceptive people to try to understand the world.
I want to spend a day in life of jihad -- the lawist, which is why he's called "Bople" and used to use religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And whatever can the jihad-de-de-daughter do when Parliament was paying for the U.S. and making a choice campaign called "Amers" -- I do jihad, and I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to let the Mafiosi to let them spend a national hero.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, and to the reason, with a project called "Rearedom," where you put a police phone on the streets of Kabul, and steal cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking money from them, giving them money, and give them money to the police in Kabul, and they hope that they're going to give us 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at what conflict in Afghanistan was considered to be the "citiial conflict."
The war and the stranger who came to him, created a new environment for Style and fashion, and we can only capture it by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to bring a local guard with a local supplement or a bunch of unregulated, or a few unregulated, or a few unregularized,
And I would like to see how a simple podent in Kabul looks like a pugch between 18 to 17 to create a dialogue about how today is that its development of development in the past-strowth protesters have been able to protect the people of the White House to protect themselves a brown and even a little bit of trust them.
But for all of these things, you can get to jail, they can be misunderstood, misdirectable.
But I do it because I need to be able to use the geography of self.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, they said exactly.
I feel that now, here's a uncomfortable tension in the room, because I wouldn't have been able to put that dress.
Fortunately, I've got a little bit more change with that.
This is the first time someone walks up on the TED stage, so you can appreciate the best that you can see.
If some women were really smart, when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
They're very uncomfortable, they're good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweils over my head, because you will all be fired me, so you'll do nothing while it's over my head.
Okay. Okay.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it wasn't that easy to be as embarrassing as this picture.
It's a picture that's powerful, but it's also a diagram of the surface.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was going to put my back and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong flas that I spent two days ago trying to change very few possibilities of our fears, and it has a lot of implications on our lives.
To be fearless, for me, is to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm an model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model of a drug, is a profit in the genetic lottery, and maybe a critical legacy, and maybe ask you what's going on with this legacy.
Now, in the last few centuries, we not only defined beauty as healthy and young and symmetrical, by the awe of the admiration, we're programmed to be biologically designed, but also as big, sin, rap and bright ones.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid to me for.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point. And maybe some fashion-pist calls, "Har, Nara, Tyra. Joan Small. Yoo.
And first, I'm talking about your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious doctor in 2007, NYU, all the modules that have been counted on the course of the course of the day, every single one that was being harassed, and that 677 megons were only 27 percent or less than four percent of the white.
The next question that always asks me is, "Can I be an model if I'm grown up?"
And first, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you this little girl is, why?
You know what? You can all be.
You can be the president of the United States, or the inventors of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart-braiation, which was absolutely wrong, because you're the first one."
If they still say this great cross-tay, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing, and you could be the editor of American bird cancer or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
And to say, you want to be a model later, it's like, if you want to get to the Jack 101 prize in the pandemic.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I'm going to show you 10 years of a recent model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be expanding.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice balloon, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo," you know, you go on the leg first, and it's going on, and it's the left, and you're on the back, you're on the side of the left, and you're just going back, you're going back, you're going back, you
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's going on.
If you've finished school, and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say a lot more, and when you say, President of America wants to be president in the world, but in life, you're going to be looking at 10 years of under the stock of underwear." You'll be looking at weird.
The next question that I've been often asked to say is, "Who is all the photos going to be inslaimed?"
And yes, so almost all of these photos are being replicated, but this is just a little bit of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and it was the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the clock.
I had to join my girlfriend.
I'm on a Pyjama party, a few days ago for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V.D. magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not images of me.
They're constructed, and they're a group of professionals, from Havalylists and make-up artists and photographers and cylists and all their assistants and the execution. They're not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Do you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-moves gloves that I can't wear, but the things I get free are things that I love to get in real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and had forgotten my money. And you had been listening to me for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she stopped a red light, and of course, it took us a statement: "Scuse me, Mr. Ww, Mr. Ww. and we could go on.
I got this costless thing because of my appearance, and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their appearance, and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York, and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and shot by the last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It's only 17,000 young black and Latino, and the question that doesn't ask me, "Am I going to stop?"
But, how often am I going to stop? When am I going to stop?"
I found out in my research for this talk, that 53 percent of all 13 year-old girls don't like their body, and this number goes up at 78 percent when they've become 17 percent.
And the last question is, "How is it to be a model?"
And I think they'd expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and wonderful."
And then we give a answer that might be given this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's just half of history, because what we never said before the camera, which I never said before was, "I feel safe."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most bright hair and the cool ones, and they're probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really difficult to get me to get a more honest balance, because on the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to put myself up here and say, "I got all the benefits of a pile that I'd be attracted to my throat." And it doesn't feel very good, "That's not going to make me happy."
It was very difficult to open a legacy of violence and race when I was one of the biggest uses of it.
I'm also happy, I'm happy to be here, and I think it's great to be here before I've been here, before 10 or 20 years, and my career has been completely disconnected, because I wouldn't probably tell my first job, or maybe I would be told, maybe I would not be paid to speak what I was going to be married in college.
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our mad-reemcession and error.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exilus, "Son, haddle Gaddi's resistance. Be sure.
But never will be something like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's almost two years since the Ottby revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass destruction and both in the traditional revolution.
I was attracted to many other Libyers, and outside of the sin to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyranny regime.
And it was there, a big revolution.
Boy, Grangian women and men were in the first row, asked the end of the regime, and he was signed by freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved to prove, by giving them a convicted of the brutal dictatorship Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the distant east to the far east, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, almost 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to break the tyranny.
Gaddi left a huge servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption, and the foundation for the end of the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has been destroyed by both infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The destruction and the challenges, I hated how many other women are going back to build civil society in Australia. We asked a confession to create a reintive transition to democracy and general.
Occare organizations have been founded in the case of Gaddafis in Benghaz, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lyb, and I started to organize some unique enthusiasm, and I started to organize workshops to organize human development and leadership skills.
I founded a wonderful group of women who started the peace collection of Congy, a movement of women, leaders of different lives, their goal is to join public management for women, and to join our right-sooding role of democracy and democracy.
I met a very difficult environment in the elections, a environment that was increasingly polarized, a environment that was shaped by selfish politics and determination.
I led a initiative to peace collection of proty women to get a vote-based rule of law, a law that would be asked to choose anyone else's background, to vote with the right, and to stop it, and to address it all the political parties between a female and two-scale, and to a broadband, and to make a directive score.
At the end, our initiative was taken over and successful.
Women won 95 percent of the nation's national government march in the first elections for 52 years.
But very long, the eucticial of elections and the entire revolution for "cause every day we were going to go to new news against violence.
We took a morning to the commutation of the ancient mosques and Sufi songs.
And one morning, we got messages about the murder of the American ambassador and attack on the message.
And again, another morning, the victim of police were violated by the Army.
And really every day, we were standing under the tyranny of the military and their ongoing competitors against the human rights and their preconceptions of rules and laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized, and separated from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, and they ended up with the beginning.
Intency, branch, and riffion became the icon of the <unk>nol<unk> era of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you to inspire you with the success story of our unconpived and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we've had a nation that has made false choice and wrong choices.
We put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections did not bring peace and security in Lybia.
Did the reconcession of women and the relationship between female rights and foreign peace and national reconciliation?
No, it has not.
What is it?
Why is our society going to continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and the opposition of both men and women?
Maybe the only thing that women didn't stop, but the female values of compassion, the Gittess and the opposition.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus shift as it took the elections, which has only been strengthed the polarization and fragmentation.
Our society needs the sexual embodiment of the woman as they need to have the numerical, negative personality of the woman.
We need to stop the name of anger and challenge one day of the urge.
We need to start with the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just accept the values, but also confuse it: Gehness instead of compulsion, collaboration rather than a competition, rather than a repulsion.
These are the ideals that need one of the guards who desperately need to be able to get peace.
Because peace has a nightmare, and in this Alchemie, it's about the defending of the feminist and masks.
That's the true compliment.
And that's what we need to do before we do it sociology.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," peace" -- "I believe the word of the song of God, shed."
The word "rawem" again, who is known in all the earlyham traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "lood" "mear" and symbolized the mother of feminine, the whole humanity, the man of the man, the female and the female, all the tribes, all of them, were all over.
And just like the mother's elbow in the embryo, which grows, completely, is the fundamental self-interest of compassion, all of its existence.
And so we told us, "My Gittle is all the things that make you."
And so we told us, "My Gnissade was a little bit of a little bit of my send."
Let's all of us have the art of the Gitte.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were not talking about Kim Bl, but we didn't learn very much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until anything change.
At seven years, I saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
I wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother took a letter with a letter, from the sister of a colleague of mine.
And it was like, "If you're laughing here, our five family members will not be on the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all together on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly, I went down the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
There was a flower on the ground, and a blood-touch child in its arm was smelled in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because everyone was so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'0s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were the famine, and many more people survived, because they ate grass, beetles and tree bars.
And more and more likely, the power drop up at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the user, where we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea, and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amad, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very narrowed, and allow Northstans to escape.
But many die die.
Sometimes I saw bodies moving in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I'd never thought it needs 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like Northstath Indians, but soon I realized it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korea will be seen by illegal immigrants in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in complete fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare room was true when I was trapped by the Chinese police, and was sent to the police department.
Somebody was accused of being the North Bronx, so they tested my Chinese faces, and they gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid of that fear, I thought I would explode my heart.
If you were immortal, anything immortally, I could be locked in and unlanged.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the question, a police officer said to the other, "That was a false thing.
She's not a North Bronx.
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for foreign messages in China calledyl, but many of them get caught by the Chinese police and being rejected.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they got caught, they ended up with tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans have not been so lucky.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans being caught in China, and they're exported to North Korea, where they're tortured, or they're being locked up in public or publicly.
Although I had been in my late journey, there's not so many Northstans.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard to survive.
And even after they learned a new language and found work, their world can be put on a moment in the head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was going to leave myself in South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
But I've realized the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been stuck in very close to each other, because of 67 years, it's part of the part.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
I am the South or Northstorean?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't realize the adaptation of the Southern Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing to record the previous record of university.
Just as I was a new life-freated, I got a shocking call.
The North Bronx Fund, the money I sent from my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to move around, to a remote place on the country.
They had to be able to run as fast as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to take a tremendous route back to the path of freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took myself back to the northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to set them up, over 2,000 miles from China, and then after Southeast Asia.
The bus station took a week, and we got almost caught.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the evidence of all, and started asking questions.
Because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese minister was elected to criticize my family, I was determined, and he said that they were deaf, and I was the person who was in their head.
He looked at me, and he was very suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go to the laol border, but I had to go all my money to the border of Lazarus.
But even after we've gone to the border, my family was compounded because of illegal border.
After having paid money sentence and paid paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly after the time, my family was compelled back, in the capital of L.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything to keep my family out of freedom, and we've been so close to that, but my family was arrested just before the south-dath minister.
I went up and I went from the foreign authorities and the police department, trying to clean my family, but I had no money to pay back and pay money to pay back to pay money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then the voice of a man, and he asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is concerned about it.
In the broken English, and I explained my situation and not to give a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get it out of jail.
I thank him very much heart, and I said, "Why are you going to help me?"
"Don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Bronx people."
I realized that this was an symbolic moment in my life.
The previous foreign opponents, for me, designed a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope to have the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I was together in South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they get into a new country, they start to start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learning English, education, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still stay in contact with families, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be more hopeful to succeed North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you one request today.
Don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Si is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not be heard.
Remi knows what love is.
It gives them unconcurity, and it gives them no enough to give them a sense of them.
He's not a stupid. He doesn't look at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he was singing songs from our childhood, he's trying to think about words that I'm not even even even even even even even remembering one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel's big. It's very good-looking.
It has absolutely a useless memory.
It also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate lady, but he remembers the book on my iPod's book on my iPod, conversations that he was the first result of the teystet on my arm, and a lady named Gaga's birthday.
Don't listen to it?
But many people are not right.
And indeed, their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood wrong.
But what my heart encouraged me, and my soul has influenced me, was that, although that was the case, despite the case, they were not considered as usual, that was only one that it could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "cacism" -- it's a complex disorder of the brain, that influenced social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's a way that it's different in each individual, it's Si's so different than Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, you will find a new diagnosis in autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing societies in the world, there's no such cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember myself at any day without listening.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very afraid of a lot.
He didn't want to play the same way that the other babies did, and actually he didn't seem very interested in being interested in me.
Si lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, put the washing machine and eat everything that came out of it.
And as he was older, he became different, and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the ravels and the never-fatter hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being who never had been.
Amazing.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back with the thoughts that taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
And the normality is the beauty that gives us differences, and the fact that we're different, it doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another way of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Si, and to Sam and to you, it would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody has a gift in it, and in all of us, honesty, is the ultimate authority of behavior.
The chance of scale, progress, and change will die in the moment where we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Docon has been filled with us with awe and curiosity, with this photo, with a robot, and it's a robot that's been cut through a paper, and it's only a million times a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images a second.
I'm going to introduce you a new kind of photography, the Femto-A-Ari photographer, a new technique that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at the outside of our view, or without looking at a <unk>-ray in our body, and really ask what we do with "make camera."
Now, if I take a laser check and turn it into a billionth of a second -- these are several set of a second -- I'll make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter, and this photo of this photo, this project will move into speed, speed speed, and it's going on -- like a regular year, a normal thing.
So if you take this project, this photons, take it in the bottle and put it in it, how will these photons break into the bottle?
What's going on in the time, what's going on in slow motion?
So, this whole event -- -- -- --
So, think, this event actually takes less than a nanotole -- it takes the light to get back this route -- but I'm going to add it to the effect of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't funded this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
Our pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photons of a tube that starts to move through and break the end.
Part of the light is coming out on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons finally end up to break the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going to be stuck in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are coming out of the table, and because of the reflection of the side, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on a few images.
Now, if you take a common project now and let it go back and take the same route back and slow it back to the number of billions, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
Day one day, a week? No, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a slow, regular project in motion.
And what does it look like with something still-time photography?
You can see again, like the waves of the table, the Tomteorite and the wall is throwing over the back of the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It would be the way that nature would paint this picture, each one of the things that looks like a pemto image, but of course, our eye looks together.
But if you look at this Tombes again, you will recognize that when the light hits the Tom Ship, it's not going to be able to get it apart. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is closed, and the light is going to wake up and come back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this tap-to-mone camera is built in your Camerahy, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find if you're a fruit, without touching it.
So how did my team do this camera work at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you do a photo with a short-term mass of mass, you have very little light, but we added a billion times faster than your short-term expansion, so you get a little bit of light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons, a million, and you're going to draw it back and start to combine it with very clever synchronic synchronicization, and combine these gigabytes of data to create this video clip, and create this video clip that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superpower: Can you see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn something out of the door.
It's going to be cut down, go into the room, a part of it will be reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use this extracellularized increase of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
The wall is hidden in the wall, and we're going to put the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the GNropications Center, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be able to break this light project and turn it back to this wall, and this photons will be pulled into all directions, and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden soup, and then we'll turn the light back, and then turn the door into a part of the light of the light, and then a tiny bit of light, and a tiny fraction of the tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny photons, and then
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
She has a very good time-effective, and she can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is to go beyond.
So by taking a laser, we can take a pipe image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take a lot of these pictures, collect dozens of these images, and try to analyze the different light-sensitive, we can see the object, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our creationization.
We've got a little bit to do before we can do this lab in practice, we could use cars, we can avoid the collisions, recognize what's behind the curve, or we can look for them in dangerous offspring by looking for light, we can look out, we can turn through the window, or we can build the end of the end of the back, or we can build the bottom-up box of the wall, and also see the blue-up box of the
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, which is really a call for scientists to think about a pro-to-Actor, now, because a new visualization process could actually solve the next generation of medical development problem.
So, like Docpton, a scientist, even a scientist, science has become a art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we've been collecting every time, not only the scientific imaging process. We can create a new form of computer photography, and we can look at this wave of color, and we can look at each other't see that we're listening to see that wave of light-up, and we
But it's also something fun about this.
If you look at those waves under the bottles, you see that the waves are moving away from us.
We should be able to move the waves to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out we've been able to take almost light-speed effects, weird effects, and Einstein would have been like to see this picture.
The order of events in the world is going to appear in the camera, in a way, by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, whether you're interested in photography, or not just trying to create a new visualization for medicine or new designs, since our invention, we've been able to do all the data open up on our website, and hope that the "s the "sctor, the creative and the research community, we should stop us, we should stop the data clip, and start to start to start to start the next 3D clip, and start to start the next two-by-by
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities that we can make better lives in our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the road so many convictions are not passed. But we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors, and use things like a little bit of a little bit of a tangle, and a circle of chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much money the rent they want to pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without complaining to each other?
How can we share our memories on the front of the buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free-own houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being disrupted by the giant eavesdles that have been served for hundreds of years, hate and shrenched shadows, and I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time someone ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city that is left with most of the rest of the entire hives in America.
I've been thinking about where this house is, and I'd thought about how I can make it more, and I'd also think about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great grateful gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I'm now important in life.
But I'm really hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life-time lives, forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned to a side of the house in a giantboard and wrote a branch of the gaps: "I want to die, I want to die, everyone who can take a piece of life, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I'd expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and grew.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written by the people on the wall.
I'm going to be threatened by piracy."
I'm going to be hungry, I want to stand on the International News border."
I'm going to wear a victim, I want to sing for millions of people."
I'm going to have a tree that I'm going to feed."
I'm going to be hungry, I want to live in the web."
I'm going to die, I want to keep it in my poor."
I'm going to be hungry, I want to be somebody's pavallic.
I want to be dead, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, the wine and the hard times.
And it's really important to know that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new way to make it a more and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for the time and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of the messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with her community, so my colleagues and I built a construction network in countries like Kazan, Australia, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to go back and share more and more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right view, thinking that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I realized that the preparation is one of the things that drives us most.
The idea of death is that it shows us life.
We're going to show our common places that are best to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, that people can't help us to make better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved in a related math. I'm involved in a special problem for anyone who is involved in a mixed math, is that we're like companies.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing today.
It's one of the most human activity.
We're just looking at the sight of the Greek ballet and the hives you're going to see.
If you have a huge amount of knowledge and abilities, and maybe a fundamental prediction that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's, slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It's also what it does to me with the people who had been able to hold up a ballot of time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to live with the unhealthy symptom of weakness, sin, mood, mood, and others who are causing this disease. So we need to discover the objective skill before it's late.
We need to measure progressively, and ultimately the only way to know whether there is cure, if we have an objective measure of this question.
In trouble, there's no biomarkical activity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this is this 20-minute test for neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that outside clinical studies will never be done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
I would want to save this in the hospital, which if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't have to be a brander hospital.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to look at the neurological field.
So I want to suggest to you a non-conventional method that we're trying to achieve that, because we're all at least virtual, virtual, like my name of Janrips.
So here's a video of the vibrant vocal lobets.
This is what happens in the healthy state when someone has a speech sign. We can look at our wrong ballets because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs, if we could make a match, and we all have the genes for this. I mean, FoxP.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of practice.
Think how long a child needs to talk until it's learning.
We can choose to determine the position of the vibrant vocal lobets, and as the limbs, the receiver also has been affected by Parkinson's brain.
You can see an example of the bottom record, for the unregular vocal lobets.
We're going to see the same symptoms.
Beautical, weakness, abissability.
The language will be re-fipped and blind, and this is an example of why.
Now, this impacts can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones, and with a broad effects of data, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can actually find where someone is in a compartmentality between a disease and health and health, just because of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
Not so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both are exactly exactly exactly. That's not the right test of experts.
So you can be done in their own.
They're very fast, take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
So we can now get these amazing goals right now.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
There is no way to do a routine control in the hospital.
We can increase objective data by increasing observation.
We can do low-cost mass training for clinical trials, and first a study of all population will be possible.
We now have the opportunity to search for the first time to search for biomarkers before it's too late.
We're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's disease-based economy.
With Aose and patient's Day, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the next goals.
We have a call of calls that are accessible to the three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Everyone, with no Parkinson's disease, can be a cheap way to leave a few cents. I'll be known to be familiar with joy, that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you tell samples, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who's not healthy and who?
What do you do with all of these samples?
What's going to happen is that the patient has to be told during the call call, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some may not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to put it into the order to figure out what the actual code for Parkinson's disease.
It's got its 86 percent accuracy right now?
It's much better.
My students Thorenis -- I have to confuse it because he's done this amazing work -- now it's been shown that it's also working on the cell network, which allows this project, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means that people can call the phone -- and they could do the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Tiver, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows of my father's father's background, and the one behind the campus of the National Park.
The National Park is just in the South, and that means that wild animals can leave the park every single time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and found it dead. It was horrible. It was our only hives.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we came together with our animals and the National Park of the sky, so our animals are so much as much as that.
I learned to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior, they protect our tribe and our native ones. They're also led to this problem.
They kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible between six and nine years for the cows of his father. That's how it was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that not really would help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't go. I kept going on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think, and I was standing next to the cow's cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird search, and go back again. But next time, they come and say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they take the position and kill our livestock.
One night, I stopped the ruball. I was walking around the hand with a paple, and this time, the lions didn't catch up.
And lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
As a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once again, the new radio, I took the new radio apart the day, and the day, she was almost about me, but I learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old car battery, and a driver-to-fanger from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn out to the right or left. It's noisy.
And I put a switch on the road to turn the lights off and turn them down.
This is a little pearle from a broken bag lamp.
And then I built all together.
The solar elephant is able to capture the battery, which provides the battery to the right-pay. I call it a transite generator.
And the right-sensitive is a little bit more noisy.
You see that the eggs are pointing out to the outside because the lions come from there.
And so this looks like the lions coming when they come.
The lights turn down and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the rubck. And I was in the bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been running this in our home, and since, we had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of animals in lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I'm installing the lights. You can see lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're working really well.
I'm going to use my idea in almost Kenya, including for other predators like hyena or leopard seals, and the lights also serve to keep out the elephants from near.
My invention was to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps to participate in corporate returns and education.
I even put my friends home, and we install the lights where there is no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I was just one week ago, and I was just a boy who was wearing a boy who was wearing cows. I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to be sitting in a sitting."
And I'm here today.
I was able to draw a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to quit lions, but by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions. We can live together, side, with the lions, without arguments.
Ash Oln. In my language, that means this: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you're listening to your own.
So you have this scholarship now. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list on the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on a electrical fence. A driver's electrojection?
Yes, I know, electrical pale is already invented for a long time, but I want to have my own own.
You've tried it all, not true -- yeah, I've tried to wait for a while, but the attempt to get back because I got a break.
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to be going to go back to each step of your head, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and no one of them made me.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no way to shoot a picture. Not even after the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife took this picture where I was holding my daughter on her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57 cents and five.
And so one year later, we were back in New York, and we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where it goes from ...
When the third birthday of my daughter came up to me, my wife said, "Hey, why do you want Sabina not to go to New York, and do a father-child account to lead the ritual to continue?"
At the time, we started asking to ask the banish tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal gesture is when you're having a complete stranger, you know, you're going to get enough to get your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, someone has never been stuck with our camera.
And we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This was just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a previous moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us for a week in October, to keep the time and change our time, and how we've been able to change our year, not just physically, but to reflect.
Because we always do the same picture, our perspective changes in time, while it's always going to reach new windows, I can see the life with her eyes, how they deal with everything, and how it looks.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something we estimate and expect every year.
Last, while one of our travel, we went out and suddenly stayed like they're breaking, she shows on a red marker, a caret that she learned as a little kid, earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings she had thought of her five-year-old, at the same point.
She said she remembers how her heart was breaking out of her chest when she saw the store nine years ago.
And now they look at them in New York to high schools, because they're really going to be interested in studying in New York.
And I realized that I was so clear: The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the unconscious of memories.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a little family photo.
I'm always the one who's always doing this picture.
I want to encourage everyone here to come to the image and not ask someone to ask, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
