When I was 11 years old, I was shocked one morning by the sounds of the thumb.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly covering the news.
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
I mean, a real school.
The Taliban were pushing the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was preparing for five years to be a boy, and my older sister who had no longer been asked to go to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to predict where we went.
We're eating our hidden books in the grocery store so it looked like we'd just go buy.
We've been done in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
Over and over again, the class had to suddenly come out for a week, because the Taliban had been swallowed.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Did they accept us?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was lucky enough to grow up in a family where education was important and received daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
But my mother was trained, but she became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the seventh school, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first one in his family, who ever received a school.
For him, it was always clear that his children would receive an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it a much higher risk for sending his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by the Taliban, from our lives, of the constant fear and the perspective of mindless.
I was very good to give up. But my father said, "My grandfather, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced from your house in war.
But one thing that will always remain with you is what's in there, and even if we're going to pay attention to our blood supply for your school, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give me back to me?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed since decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree as a junior degree, and if my family didn't have been used so much to my education, I would also be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly, middle of the Lakotabury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he was accused of sending his daughters to school, one of the first people who was congratulated to me.
He's not just a graduate degree of college, but also because I was the first woman and I'm the one who runs him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education for women.
So I helped myself start to make SOLA, and maybe the only board service for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school teacher is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school are, with a great ambition, are to take all of them to the chance.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, like my parents at the time, despite all the time, and against the deterioration of all the time.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students' father's father.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA in her village, and they are just leaving the death of a bomb on the side of the road for a few minutes.
When he got to the house, the phone rang, and a voice attacked him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
He said, "So now, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter in the game because of your old and over-taking imagination."
What I've discovered in Afghanistan, which is often passed away in the West: The majority of us who have succeeded is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realized that her success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to play an important role in our success.
Rather, they're often the ones who are more engaged and more persuasive for a very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is absolutely unaware.
Now, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are beating the school bank.
Afghanistan seems like America looks like this.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term, and they change with the decline of the U.S. troops again.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, if I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them, who encourage them, I see a very promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited opportunity, and I remember the girl every day, go to the ROLA.
They have big dreams like me.
Thank you.
Everything I do, but I'm a living life -- I've been coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project that we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years ago, we're an Italian good person and we're very good at work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we measured.
Our first project, which was inspired by the Tambezi, was one of the people we wanted to show the people of Sambica, how to raise food.
We came to the Southeast of Southeast, in this shiny valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the native population to grow the Asian tomato and zchini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest on it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such an agile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't hire anything, we said, "Thank God we are here!"
"Wait time to save people from Sambias in front of the starvation."
Of course, everything is wonderful in Africa.
We had this brutal tomato tomato. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Torambers, "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomato system was red and red, over night, about 200 oats of nests came from the river and all the stuff.
We said to the Torambians, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you tell us this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French guys did, and after I saw what they did, I became pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We used to put the nilperper in the first place.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we haven't called the world's no human being.
You should read the book "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, she's a post-bish economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion Euros in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read her book.
Think of a African woman, what we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionare, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
Realarchal: I treat every culture that I would be, like I'd be my children. "I love you so much."
Patronishening: I treat every other culture as though they were my servant.
So, white people in Africa are called "bindery," boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "mallallic" by singing. He said, especially in economics, when people don't want help, they keep them alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
Now, this is the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not a neococococolicential?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react to people and I created a system called business fund, which never is being launched, nobody will ever be motivated, but you'll be forced to be the service of the local passion, the local man who has the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you sit with the local people.
We're not working by offices.
We're in cafes. We're in Kneipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We're closing up with friends and finding out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea to you.
If this person doesn't like what you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for its own growing is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this one, many years ago, why, rather than getting into a community, and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have a business of entrepreneurs, and you'll never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunity.
You know, planning has this blinking spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be in public meetings.
We work on one to do this, we need to be made by a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
There's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the faculty doctor, the school doctor, who's in the workplace, who's sitting with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the means to transform your passion in a way of changing life.
I tried this in the agileity, West Europeian epidemics.
I was also doing the time, trying to escape the flushy flaws, where we tell others what to do,
And so I was walking through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, my first customer, and I helped him, and he was able to bring fish into a garage, he was Maori, and he helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and he went to the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us help us help us help us?"
I helped go to these five fishers, and I couldn't sell them to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million cents per million dollars, but to Japan for 5<unk>Kilo, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us help us do this?"
I'd been walking 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So -- So the government says, "Do you mind it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's a cartoonist before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Rreation is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
So planning is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, not knowing what the smartest man Christelard wants to do with her money and her energy.
You need to learn how to get this to one.
You have to give them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they'll get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
For what's the most attractive you have heard in the talk today?
"Hear, passionate people. You've been accused of that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the over-the-the-cost fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The restonian species of state is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, build, transport them and turn them into a credential.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget it.
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk to the city of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they mapped what would happen in the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was a holistically: The city of New York wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows on this speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get done with the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd been in the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that keeps life from New York.
What happens? Forty years later, in 1900, there were 1001 car maker manufacturer, 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing they need to be offered to them is disclosion.
They don't get to come and talk to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
From the smallest and biggest company, everyone has to be able to perform three things: To sell the product must be great, the propulsion market needs to be great, and the financial accounting process has to be huge.
You know?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 idiological companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wdohouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, just one: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 16 students in North Korea entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransons National Geographic, and the job is to support the 163 students in the first page of Richard Bransographic Autobiography, how often the word "discovery" and how often the word "tal" and how often we call "tune."
Never "I" and 32 times "we"
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who have a small professional background in cafeteria and Bars, and their committed buddy, who has done what someone who did for this gentleman who speaks about the E. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? You can make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate leadership to help them find the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of the human population can change the culture and the economy of this community, just by understanding the passion and energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it must be to be to be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- to give media education to communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid of these students with their large brains and their large books and their large books, not trusted words.
But when the conversation came to me, as Alice took me down to the case of a stroke, and a door saw a new world.
As I felt like I was talking to the students, and I was amazed to think about the thought they had, and I wanted to think that other of these miracles,
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religious scientist, we're looking for these conversations.
But these great conversations are not something that happens when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
I want to show you some approaches, how you can make it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy doing with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to is, well, what?
Tell us why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
It's not just telling us that their feids are examined, but it also tells us that their feids, the gloves, the gloves of the bone, are examined because it's important to learn and treat osteopalosis.
And when you describe what you do, then you're all about preventable arguments.
In the world, there's a barrier to the understanding of your mind.
Sure, could you use your "dirl" and "discovery" but why don't you just tell yourself "Space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
To make your mind understood, it's not the same as to cut down their level.
As Einstein said, "Take things as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, a few things are in mind: examples, stories and analogies. So in this way, you can pull us into your boss.
And when you show your work, then take the dots off.
Have you ever asked yourself why it's called "rerererererererererereacting?"
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is taken to weeks, and with those dots, the first ones you have to imagine.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also also also fits to the talkal part of our brain, and it's so we're focused on it.
This example of Geneber Brown is much more potent. It shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable, that even the inspiration was the unique design of the Eiffrack.
The trick here is to use one individual, just to use an image-controlled sentence that the audience, if it can even lose the thread, use graphics and graphics that also stimulate our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up this door and see the wonders of the country, which is to spread science and technology.
So the engineers I've taught you, I've been taught to make a tight contact with the U.N. in me, I want to sum up all of this with a equation.
So if you look at your science and you look at your professional stuff, you'll be sharing it through the relevance, and you'll say the audience, what's important, and you'll multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work, and you'll find that there's something that is unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was really looking for myself.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
You can change a life phone and give a personal freedom to it.
You can film a crime in human history in Syria.
You can dial a message on a cell phone and you start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a song with a cell phone, you can put it up on sound file and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city in time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed them to the streets.
We've been in the fall of 1989, and we've been imagining that all these people who were coming from and asking change, had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone phone on it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
This is a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today, my cell phone and my cell phone wants to talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines are full of information.
Data data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.R. has signed a right line.
This rule is called a law enforcement line.
This rule is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service service service in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who's sending an email?
Who's sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, until two years from your phone company, or your Internet service provider.
And all over Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this protection system.
We want self-sognition in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all of them said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands people were crossing on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Fake fear instead of fear."
And some people even said this could be going to the Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headbloodi in easternland.
And I'm also wondering whether this really works.
Can this really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone.
So I asked my phone company, the Price Teleject, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send all the information that you've stored on me.
And I once asked her, and she said, "You know, she did not get a right answer. Just a little bit of blue Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life, which is her catalog.
So I decided to put a court process on them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German telecom said no, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'll take back the ripping back, which is what they'd send me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court official decided that the introduction of the E.U. Senate was a German law enforcement threat.
So I got this ugly brown, brown strip with a CD.
And the CD was this.
35.830 lines of information.
I first saw it and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. I'll hold it.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is the protection control of the law enforcement.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and down.
You can take every step I do, and you can track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to Clnn, and how many calls I'm going to walk.
All of this is possible by this information.
It's a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like this, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then some friends call me up and they call me a few friends.
And after a while, you call you up and you call you up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what makes society.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who speaks to who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I first said, we imagine all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of Colombia phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi knew who was doing this, and if the statue had known who the leader had been, then that might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall wouldn't have happened.
And even after that, the case of the ice curtain, the case.
Because today, national agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and fair.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all the time.
But even self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old old.
When you go home, you're telling yourself your bosses, just because companies and national locations have the opportunity to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight yourself in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: In the wake-out, rapid-talking restaurants, Brakkall.
So the city plan is coming and they survived the name of South Central so that it's for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going on in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Lortive stores, rapid-diving restaurants, bureaucratic spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in Central Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivehrus and the Drivebysy.
The cometic is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebysy.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the most remote illness.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even think of that.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to food if you go from the house every time you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to realize that the skug chairs bought and sold like park stations.
I see dialogue tours going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that's what we need to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't like to have a joke for a 45minute night-minute night to get an apple that is not mediated by pesticides.
So I plant a food hotcase in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to dedicate it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I must be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the position.
So I came to my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started planting my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of pre-performance group, put together by gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, it's totally voluntary and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone would be worried.
The city came to me, and he basically showed me a dial-up, and said I had to remove my garden, the carrier was becoming a confession of a constellation.
And I thought, "Come on, right?
Give us a question about growing food from food in a piece of land that is absolutely not what you're all about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name with it."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times, wind got wind from it. Steve Lopez did a story about it, and talked to the city department, and with a member of Green Ground Groundcraft. They signed a petition on Change.org, and we were successful with 900 regulations.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My town even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. In the United States, most of the paladas in the property of the city.
They own 67 miles in the palms.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoatoes plant crops.
Why the hell should they not find it okay?
By growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my seduction relationship, I'm telling people that they should grow their own food.
My own food is like printing its own money.
You see, I have a legacy in Central Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
My art is graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been covering the walls, I'm putting lawns and sewage spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants, and the trees are my closest to this stuff.
You'd be surprised what the ground floor can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunblower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the soil.
They would wonder how children are affected by it.
Doctors are the most therapeutic and most charmive act you can do, especially in the city.
You get strawberries.
I remember that time, when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked at her.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason on the street."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just profoundly empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye devil, no, I'm not afraid that she's going to blow up.
It's the one on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless garden in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to take the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how it would have planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was just for a moment.
Green Growers have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had to come to our accountations, so 50 people came and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered to get paid by it if they're not shown to how food and body affects food, they're blind, whatever you're listening to them.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
I see the garden garden as an opportunity where we can train these kids to care for their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground floor, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole apartment in gardens, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship ships and turn them into a healthy cafe.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails, because free is not sustainable.
The cometic of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the joy and honorful when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gangs.
We need to turn around the image of the gang sky.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a shuttery, right?
And let's let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit in a stupid chairs and make a meeting where you talk about making any cheeks.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, in my garden so we can plant any snails.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnollynnnesty."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nolly monaster" means "the unforacherist politician."
Even though a newspaper writer gave a better definition: "A Snollydydy is someone who is planning for a faculty, independent of party, program or performance, and success by the pure power of the Victorian determination.
I have no idea what the toy is.
Some of the words I think of.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So for example, 1771, people were allowed to be signed according to the British Parliament, newspapers not the same word of debuting.
And that was actually back on the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was tracking the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it a hug, but he was courageous enough to consider, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first test for the sentence "so" is strong as Brass." Many people think.
So, you know, Brassgeness is the word for the English word for the wheel.
But that's not true. It's back to a convicted authorities of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are interrelated, I want to take you with the United States at the time when it's just reached independence.
You're looking at the question, how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
What's called the leader a universal nation?
It's been discussed in Congress for an infinite amount of time.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions to do.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the rest of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
Not so special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that's the best way to do it.
They weren't monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a specific time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was a little bit bored because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the book of a primeman who always writes, "I'll be thinking about the same topic."
The reason for the ticking, and the long-term was that the Representatives house was against the Senate.
The signature house didn't want Washington to be seductive. They didn't want to make it.
King, and maybe gets it to ideas on his after his release.
They wanted to give him the most humble, most crippling titles that they thought of.
This is a cover name.
President didn't invent the title. He did not exist before. But he meant that someone was signing a gathering.
This is something like the preference of a jury.
He didn't have the size as the term "warting" or "wighing water."
Sometimes there was a very small president of a massive and government group, but it was a really unremone title.
That's why the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign and meet foreign opponents.
Who's going to take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of America's United States?
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate had not been on the Senate.
Instead, the word "Stistity" is to use, but they wanted to make sure that they were absolutely oblivious to their respect for the opinions and institutions of civil nations, whether it's a monarchy, where the government is assertively respected, not the state of the United States -- and the president of the United States, not to be responsible to the preservation of the president, and the president, but the president of the preservation.
You can learn three interesting things from this.
First, and that's the best I find -- so far, I can't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, was just crying the title. He's waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary is -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Three, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of America today doesn't sound as humbling, right?
This has to do with something more than 5,000 nucleic swamps that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet drone and all this stuff.
Reality and story has given the title of the size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They've got a respectful title.
And the other concern, the sound of mind, now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombers and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost, because nobody feels very humbling when you're told that you're now the president of the United States of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to try to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality much more than the words that might ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck on a board of about 50 rebellion on Stinnalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I would love my black Conclighty gloves against a pair of brown leather and a rocket in the direction of the government force that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time before I was raised with the war, but with dinner party party party and football games at Samens and committing with the racist South African-American protesters who live with the non-governmentalism and Afghanistan and Vienna and Viennge before I knew what it was.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, I'm a man-made Afghane, South-stathing of God Gnnesty, and a radically political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and created.
So, in Afghanistan, there's a lot of great things about art, but I personally don't like to paint rain corners. I want to make art that draws people's personalities and authority and rewilling reality and actually using a kind of a creative people's imagination to try to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- Wangster, who puts his jihad against the communist, like "Popblood Blingleing" and use armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad dream as if for the parliament to do a job and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Tell me, jihad. I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow these Mafauiosi to take care of themselves as national superheroes.
I want to go to Afghanistan on the bottom, with a project called "Rakening," where you give yourself a cop to build a false control center on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money and the police in Kabul, and they refuse them to take care of the police in the police in Kabul, and they hope they would take care about 100 dollars.
I'd like to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become the case for the Intermodist conflict.
The war and the stranger who came to him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I would be able to fill up a local slave and a few repressed care systems or a multi-touched vigo-like vigo.
And I'd like to see what a simple rewriting of Kabul looks like between 18thowing Appouse's App to create a dialogue about the current development development development of the millennial protesters in the past colonial rhetoric of the man's "The White Beem" to protect the brown man themselves and even to even to protect them a little civilized.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, you can be misunderstood, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
Just for 10 years, just said.
I felt like this is a very uncomfortable tension in the room, because I wouldn't have been attracted to this dress.
Fortunately, I've got a little bit more about the change.
This is the first time someone walks into the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happy thing to see.
If some women were really beaten up when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I read on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds of what you think of me.
It's not everybody who has the chance.
These interruptions are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you'll all be fired me, so you'll do nothing while it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, I'm not sure it's not that embarrassing as this picture.
It's a picture of powerful, but it's also a picture of superficial.
I've just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides the surgery or the wrong thing that I did, two days ago, I was preparing for the work, there are very few ways to change our utterness, and the expressions of our utterness -- even though it's superficial and ineffective -- a big impact on our lives.
To be fearless for me today is to be honest.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
Now I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be an model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've defined beauty not just as healthy and young and symmetrical in the awe of admiration, but also as big, soft, feminist and bright-world.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was paying for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion concerts like, "Haltie. Naomi, Tyraagra Smw. Liu. Whoa."
And first, I'm commentating your model model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I've got to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the length, every single one who was executed, and that 677 modules were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always been asked to me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown up?"
And I'll say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give is this little girl, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja psychiatric surgeon, which would be absolutely wrong, because you would be the first one."
If they still say that amazing cross-up, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meel.
And to say that later, you want to become a model, like you'd say you'd want to get the tip in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a recent model of knowledge, because unlike heart surgeon, it can only escape itself.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo," and then the leg goes first, and it goes back to the back, the arm, the head is on the back, and you just move back to three feet, and you just look back and you see your friends, and you're going to go back, 300 times, and you're going back,
And it looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say a lot more, and you're saying that if you want to be president of the United States, but you're in the life, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at a strange.
The next question that's often given me is, "Am you going to ban all the photos?"
And yes, as much as any photos are being replicated, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that was the first time I wore a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this will be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the Shootings.
My friend had to come and join me.
I'm on a Pyjama party party, a few days before a Shooting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeupists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the pre-programry. They're not me.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "Would you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-mul flights that I can't wear, except the things I'll get free, things that I'll get in real life and talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend with a terrible driver, and she was left over a red light, and of course, we were stopped, and it took me to say, "Excuse me, Mr. Woode Day," and we could keep going on.
I got this costless thing because of my view and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay for their appearance and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York, and I've been hiding over 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and filtered over the last year, 85 percent of black and Latino, and most young men.
It's only 177 young, male and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Am I listening to?"
But, "How often am I going to stop? When I'm going to stop?"
I found out that in my research, 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent if they've become 17.
The last question I'm saying, "How is it a model to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and thin hair, you feel very happy and great."
And then we'll give a response that might be given this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspiring people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never tell before the camera, what I never said before, is, "I feel unsafe."
And I'm not sure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had a thin legs and a glowing hair?"
And then you should meet a few modules, because they have the most thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest of the flips, and they're probably because of the appearance of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very difficult to get me to a more honest balance, because at the end, I felt very uncomfortable at getting here and saying, "I got all the benefits from a stack that got dressed into my throat." And it doesn't feel so good to say, "And I don't always feel happy."
It was very difficult to open up a legacy of oppression for gender and race when I'm one of the biggest users of it.
I'm also happy, and I'm honored to be here, and I think it's great that I've been here before 10 or 20 years ago, and my career has been still left, because I wouldn't tell you how I was going to get my first job, or maybe I'd be paid to tell you what I was doing college, which is so important.
So if you take something from this talk, hopefully, we all recognize the power of the image in our deceived successes and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, Thaddafi Gaddafi. Beet.
But never will I be like a Gaddafi revolution."
There are almost two years since the Argentising revolution, inspired by the waves of mass performance in both the world's and also in the Egyptian revolution.
I started with a lot of Libyers, within and outside the Libyens, trying to challenge the day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyranny regime Gadadis.
And there it was, a big revolution.
Boy, gay women and men stood in the first row, asked the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They proved an excellent courage by giving them a convicted dictator of Gaddafis.
They showed a very strong sense of solidarity, from the east to the distant West, to the South.
After a period of time, a warary war and almost 50,000 deaths, we managed to let us clean our country and to drop the tyranny.
Gaddafi still leaves a great master, a legacy of tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the end of the day.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrant regimes have destroyed both the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the mythic society.
The destruction and the challenges, I'd call, as many women, to rebuild the civil society of Lybans, and we asked them to have a confession of democracy and national balance.
Occasionally, 200 organizations were founded, and immediately after Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of performance, human development and leadership skills.
I founded the peacebuilding platform by women, the dominant women, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to be in public for the societicity of women, and to be the right with the moral justice of democracy and peace.
I met a very difficult environment in the election, a community that was more polarized, a community that was characterized by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a Department of peacekeeping to get women with a legal choice, a law that anyone would choose, whether they should vote, and they should vote for the right, and most of all the political parties, to the female and female, to the horizontal level, and to make a decision-making.
At the end, our initiative has been taken and successfully.
Women won 95 percent of the nationwide lawyer for the first elections for 52 years.
But it was pretty clear that the euphority of elections and the whole revolution was about "cause every day we were taking new messages of violence.
We were looking at the marriage of the ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on the other morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, after another morning, the murder rate of police were signed by the army.
And really, every day, we were under the tyranny of the military and their ongoing challenges against the human burden and their preference of laws and laws.
Our society shaped by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- which they were at the beginning.
Inticit, and revenge became the icons of the Fol Age of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our discourse and the elections.
But I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, have made the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've set our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't let peace and security in Lybans.
Did the banging and the change between female and male candidates have led peace and national reconciliation?
No, she's not.
So what is it?
Why will our society continue to polarize and dominate by selfish politics of dominance and endurance, both men and women?
Perhaps the women weren't the only person who missed that, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the confession.
Our society needs a national dialogue and institutionalization process as it took the elections, which ultimately has empowered the polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the intellectual embodiment more than it takes more than it takes to the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop the name of the anger and ask a day to decide the revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just value, but also to blame it: Gnade instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than counter-contulation.
These are the ideals that need one of the guards of war to be the raptious lybans to reach peace.
Because peace has a nightmare, and in those alchemies, it's about the interpersonal and the cosmetic view.
That's the real thing.
And that's what we need to do with the most ideological evidence before we do it societic mode.
After a law from the Koran, "Salamam," peace, "I'm the word of the Good God, rally."
The word "radeem," again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "vag," "Lear" and symbolized the matal feminine who all the humanity around the man's man's man's and the female and all the tribes and all of them have been counted.
And just like the mother's assurance of the embryo that grows in him, completely exposes the cause of compassion to all of its existence.
And so we told us, "My Gnade is all about one."
So we've been told to ourselves, "My Gnade has a pre-deted attention to my serence."
Do all of us want to be the Gabbath of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were learning about Kimlung's story, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole change.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me, from the sister of a colleague of mine.
"If you were to this guy, our five family members will not be in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our body are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people in my country were suffering.
Shortly, I went down the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a child was a very cut-up kid in her arm, and she was in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because everyone was busy taking care of themselves and their family.
In the mid-'70s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were to be sick, and many others survived because they ate grass, and the beetle and the mammoth cortex.
So traffic accidents are more and more likely to be, so at night, everything about me would be oased, except the lights of China on the other side of the user's nerve that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amad, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very narrowed, and allows Northstans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought that I would be separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it took me to live in 14 years to revose.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like Northstadan refugees, but I realized that it's not just too difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Carolina's refugee refugees are seen as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in complete fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police police officer and sent to the police department to the police department.
Somebody told me that I was a Northstorean teacher, so they tested my Chinese symptoms and gave me countless questions.
I was so afraid I thought my heart would explode.
So dignity seems to be somewhat unnatural, I could be locked and signed up.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I've made it possible to control my emotions and answer questions.
After they'd been finished with the questions, a official said to another one, "That was a false failure.
She's not a Northstoreant."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are taking care of China in the foreign messages of Asyl, but many of them are caught and signed up by the Chinese police police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they eventually became released because of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China, and they're announced to North Korea, where they're tortured, or they're being reused or publicly.
Even though I had a privilege of escape, there are many other Northstans.
It's tragic that North Koreans are hiding their identity and having to fight hard for survival.
After they learn a new language and found work, their world can be replicated in a moment in the head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and I started a new life again.
I was in Southern Korea, a bigger challenge, when I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
But I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very diverged by a very, very, very 67 years of the division.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I the South or Northstoreier?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life did not get easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording interview at the university.
Just as I was more informed by my new life, I got a shocking call.
The North Korean authorities started the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be moved to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to go back an incredible route to the freedom they're going to go back.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took myself back to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them up, over 2,000 miles through China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got caught almost a few times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the epus of all, and started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I was determined, and he said, "You know, she'd be a cheer, and I'd be the her boss.
He was suspicious of myself, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to take it to the laze border, but I had to almost take care of all my money to bribe the border of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and bribe paid, my family was released in a month's house, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest attacks of my life.
I'd done everything I had to dedicate my family to freedom, and we'd been so close to that, but my family was arrested just before the South Korean Embassy.
I went and I went from the foreign agency and the police department, and I tried to desperately let my family clean, but I didn't have enough money to pay back to pay for money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is taking care of it.
In a broken English and a dictionary, I explained my situation and no to kill a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And so I gave him a lot of heart and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not going to hire you." He answered.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous foreign stranger for me was a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much to show me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I was back in Southern Korea, but the freedom is only to gain a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they arrive in a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to make the hopeful Northstans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you one request here.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very well-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them unconditionarily, and he shares them.
It's not a stupid thing. It's not looking at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine you've never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to be a little bit like me, and I remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely impossible memory.
He also has a selective one too.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate lady's pier, but he remembers the paper year of every song on my iPod, talking to the things that we had when he was four, when the first episode of the teapeties on my arm had swallowed my arm and Lady Gagas.
Don't they listen to me incredibly?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often miss and understood.
But what my heart encouraged and my soul has empowered was that although this was the case, despite the case they were not seen as usual, that only would mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autisticism," it's a complex disorder of the brain that influences social communication, learning and physical skill.
It makes a different difference in every individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And worldwide, every 20 minutes in a new autism person will find, and even though it's one of the fastest growing adult treatments in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row, putting the washing machine in the room and eating everything that came out of him.
And as he got older, it became different, and the differences became visible.
But the anger and the frustles and the never ending hyperactivity was something that was really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had otherwise been.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of time I wish they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to interact with normality.
Normality is the beauty that give us differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in us, and in all of us, honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance to do with scale, progress and change will die in the moment where we try to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edruon has been blessed with awe and curiosity, with this photo on a project of a robotic ring, and with a mass destruction of only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that can look beyond our view of the corner, or we can see a <unk>-ray image in our body and really ask, what do we mean with "Camera."
Now, if I take a laser check and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- this is several Femem Tests -- I make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter, and this photon package, this project, it's going to move in speed, and it's like a million times faster than a project.
So if you take this project, you take this photons pack and you pick it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So think that the whole event is actually spending less than a nanotole -- so long as we need to take the light back this route -- but I'll try to highlight this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, goes into the bottle with a photons pack, which starts moving through, and then the end of it falls inside.
Part of the light is flowing out on the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually end up taking the breath and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in there that's going to be in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are spread out of the side, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and take it back the same route and slow it back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you've got to sit here to see the movie?
A week, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little still-time photographer?
You can see again, this waves of the table, the Tomate and the wall flattened over the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature is drawing a photo like this, every time a Femto image, but of course our eyes see a single picture of a single image.
But if you look at this Tomber, you'll notice that if the light is going to be swallowed by the Tomring, it's going to keep the dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is coming in and the light jumps around her head after a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this tapto camera is embedded in your Camerahandyo, it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is closed without touching it at all.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a very short time of mass destruction, you've got very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your shortest mass time, so you're not going to get that little light at all.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons package, a million times, and we're drawing it again, and we're combining very clever synchronically, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data data and make very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make us invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future superheroes, can see corners?
The idea is that we're lighting on the door.
It's going to be clopped into the room, a part of it's coming back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use this more magnifying of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a soup of a puppet, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the Gature Communications Center, it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be relying down this light project, and they're going to push it on this wall, and this photons are being bent in all directions, and some of the photons will be able to break our hidden glass, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but they'll be able to get closer to the tiny little bit of the camera.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
She has a very good time-effective, and she can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance on the door, but we also know the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by taking a laser, we can take a pipe image that -- as you see on the screen -- it doesn't really make sense, but then if we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light circuit, we can see the object.
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We've got to do a little bit before we can do this from the lab, we could build cars that are inhibited and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can search for the weak injury by looking at the light that's being reflected through the open window or we can make endotos that would see the body deep around Ok Knotio and also see the right porchotch.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging, so this is really a test call for scientists, now think about Femto photography, because a new visual procedure could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edpton, even a scientist, the science has become a art, a art of the ultra-through photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, not only the scientific image processing process, but we can create a new form of computer photography with color, and we can look at all the time in the time, and we can't look at the timing of that wave between all of that wave and the time.
But it also happens a little bit fun here.
If you look at this waves under the bottle, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should be moving to us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that we're almost in light speed, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
The sequence that happens in the world in which the camera appears in a finite order, so by applying the relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, whether it's photography that's around images or whether it's creating a new visual representation for the medical community or new exhibits since our invention has been open-ended all the data and all the details on our website, and hoping that the bureaucratists and the research community should allow us to stop the 3D representation of the next camera and the next camera, we should begin to start to start to start the digital camera.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many possibilities that can help our people improve our lives.
We don't make any neighbors on the street so many of the deliberations don't get passed. But we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a blind and aphons and a circle.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without complaining to each other?
How can we divide our memories from the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the home-to-contite houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being crippled by the huge shafts that were defending out for hundreds of years of loving, drunk and cratery shade, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever thinks there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most left-up jobs in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I can make it too, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
His name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I was thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it brought me clarity on the things that are now important to me in life.
But it's hard to keep me mind that this view every day.
It's easy to lose your life in the everyday life, and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote with a treasure of the gaps: "If I die ..." I want to take a piece of chalk, think about his life and hope of that public space.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it continued to grow.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
I want to die, I want to be suited for piracy."
"I'm going to die, I want to be on a broad-time over the International Pass."
I wish I'd die. I want to sing for millions of people."
I wish I'd die, I want to plant a tree."
I wish I'd die, I want to live in sub-weed."
"I'd die, I want to keep it in my arms once."
I wish I'd die, I want to be somebody's cavallery."
I wish I'd die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to the laugh, to the wine and to the harsh times.
It's to know that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding them in a new way and in a more urgent way.
It's about creating space for us and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages with the passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a constructionbox, and now in the world like Kazanhstan, Australia, Australia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to cross our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthening us.
The idea of death is how we think about life.
Our common spaces show what's important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more possibilities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people can help us not only create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in the math, a special problem for anyone who is busy doing some of the things that are related to the math, is that we're like business workers.
No one knows what we're doing.
So today, I'm going to try and explain what I do.
"Lake is one of the most human activity.
We're looking at the face of the masterious ballett and the chefs, as you'll see.
So if Ballett is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and maybe a fundamental signal that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroying this extraordinary ability. It's also what it does to my people who were talking to Jan Abri Abrivalations who had been a ballet of mind.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
Yet, in the world, there are 6.3 million people suffering on this disease, and they have to live with the most dislike symptom like weakness, tremor, homility, and other people who are causing this disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know whether there's a cure if we have an objective measure that question can answer that question.
Now, in trouble, there are no biomarkers of control, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials will never be done.
But what if patients could be able to do that test at home?
That would save a failed tour to the hospital. What if patients could make that test themselves?
It wouldn't be a high hospital worker.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to go into the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you a unconventional approach that we try to do that, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, like my bossan Abrips.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal lobe.
This is happening in a healthy state when someone gets into the speech, and we can look at a false ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs if we could make a sound, and we all have the genes for FoxP2, for example.
And like Ballet requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to take, until it's learning.
And by clicking, we can actually determine the position of the vibrating vocal lobe, and as the limbs are also affected by the vocal commands of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the irregular vocal tonework on the bottom record.
We always see the same symptoms.
True, weakness, eality.
The language is even more and more franty, and that's an example of the antptocene.
This impact can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and precision effects software combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, so we can now tell you where someone is in a period of disease and health, just because of the mood.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
It's also pretty little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And they're exactly. They're not doing the same kind of argument from experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something's really cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
So we can do this amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logististic difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to take routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do cheap amounts of training for clinical trials and allow the first time to be able to predict the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the first time for the disease before it's too late.
Now, we're going to take the first step into this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Proposive.
With Aculab and patient'sikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough seed data for the purposes of these goals.
We have calls of reputation numbers that are available three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call cheaply to leave images for a few cents, and I'll be familiar with joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of the samples, we'll say 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who's not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to be told during the call, whether this person is suffering Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be made until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions matter, because we are in order to set that up to determine what the actual markers for Parkinson's Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, it has 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to borrow him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown now that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
So people can call -- people can call it with the cell phone and they could call it the test. People could call Parkinson's voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya, I live in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
In the back of the back, you see the cows of my father and the night behind the bar is the Nairobi National Park.
The Beijing National Park is just in the South, so it means that wildlife can rely on the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found her dead. It was the only hike.
My tribe, the colony of the Massai, thinks that we were with our animals and the Wildlife region of the sky, so our animals are so much.
I was learning to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our loved ones. They're also given to this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of the six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's because in the Nairobi National Park, there's only so few lions.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years old, is responsible for the cows of his father, and that's what it meant to me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions helping us to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried with a bird search.
I wanted the lion to think I was on the cowork.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird's check, and they go back again. But the next time they come, and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still here.
And they're reaching, and they're killing our livestock.
One night, I was holding the Stall. I was walking around with a tapelel around him, and this time the lions didn't catch up.
lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and I once took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day, it almost took me over, but I learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a direct control from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn on the right or the left. It blinks up.
And I turned on a switch to turn the lights off and turn it off.
This is a little pear of a broken flaphlight lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar elephant is carrying the battery, which provides the battery to provide electricity to the correct plant. I call it a transite generator.
And the correct plant is blinking.
You can see that the shafts are pointing out, because the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are blinking, and the lions think I'm going around the edge. And I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this at home with us, and since then, we didn't have trouble with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost many of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're really working well.
My idea now is used in all Kenya, including other predators like hyena, or leopard, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants from farms.
My invention also led me to a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is committed, and helps to engage with donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and we install the lights together where there's no one, and I'll show people how to use it.
A year ago, I only wore a boy from the savanna who carried his father's cows, and I saw airplanes over me and said, "I'll sit in a room!"
And I'm here now.
I was invited to draw on an airplane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my great dream.
I used to find lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, we can do it together, page, with the lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Oln. In my language, that means this: I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electrical fence. A electroderic theme?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, not true -- yeah, I've tried it again, but I've been given the attempt because I got a blow.
All of a sudden, Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to be re-reasing you on every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
For me, I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and no one of them has done.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no chance to shoot a picture again, not even considering the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by randomly re-dated tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife took this picture where I hold my daughter on her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57thster and fives.
So, just a year later, we went back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where that's going on ...
When the third birthday of my daughter came up with me and said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do this a father-child race to lead the ritual to continue?"
And then we started asking to ask, by asking, you know, walk-up tourists, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to be paying a complete stranger to your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody has ever been touched with our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a moment of a moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October, and change our time and how we change a year by year, not only physical, but particularly in all.
Because whenever we do the same picture, our view changes from time, as it always reaches new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how it's dealing with everything, and how it sees it.
This very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
So, as we went to a trip, we went out and suddenly we were going like this, and it's shown on a red mark on a trapeet of a dolls that had learned as a young kid at the earlier travel.
And she told me about her feelings she had thought of as a five-year-old woman at the exact same time.
She said that she remembers her heart being swallowed out of the chest when she first saw the store for the first time.
And now she looks in New York for high school schools, because she's really trying to study it in New York.
And I realized that was obvious. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious frame of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at a very small family photo.
I'm always the one that's doing the picture.
I want to encourage everyone today to come up with this image and don't you mind asking someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
