When I was 11 years old, I was dipped one morning by the sounds of a little joy.
My father heard his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual then, because the news was largely depressing.
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but my father obviously made my father very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were taking power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I spent five years old, and I was committing my older sister who was no longer allowed to go on to a secret school.
Only so, we could go to school both of them.
We took another day to see where we went.
We're going to be eating our hidden books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a shame, but in the summertime it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
Over and over again, the class had to go out for a week, because the Taliban had been to have been beating.
We never really knew how much they knew about us.
They accepted us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and successful and daughters were valued.
My grandfather had been far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- send to school and was rejected by his father.
My mother became a teacher.
This is her.
Two years ago, she went into retirement only to transform our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- was the first person in his family who ever received a school.
For him, it was always clear that his children would be able to get an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of sending his kids to school.
I know even though I was so frustrated in the Taliban in the years that I was so frustrated by our lives, by the constantly fear and the perspective of the mind.
I had a good joke to give up, but my father said, "Tirl's birthday, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be displaced in the war from your house.
But one thing will always remain: what's in there, and even if we have to pay our blood for your school payments, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have a higher degree as a Sekundary degree, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly unraventor of the Worldbury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family because he was paying his daughters to school, one of the first to congratulate me.
He doesn't just push to graduate college, but also to be the first woman and being who drives it with the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped myself start building SOLA, the first and possibly the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school school training is still risky.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to see the odds that they're offering.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, like my parents then, despite all the time, and against the odds of all odds.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of SOLA to her village, and they were out of death through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he got to home, the phone rang and a voice attacked him if he was sending his daughter to school, they would try it again.
He said, "Let me now kill me if you want, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old and overstight ideas."
What I've discovered in Afghanistan, which is often being released in the West: Behind most of us who have success, a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that their success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are beginning to be more and more compelling for a very promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
The Taliban were only going to school a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertain these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not on the length of time, and that changes with the United States's nest.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and unconcited opportunities, and that is what the girls visit every day, the SOLA.
Just like I have, they have great dreams.
Thank you.
All I do, even as I'm working, my life, was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, and 1977, I see young, but I don't -- I have been in Zambia, Kenya, I've been working with ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the engineering collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGOO, and every single project that we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, thought that we're an Italian good person and a good job in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we first found.
Our first project, which inspired my first book "Ripples" in Zambezi, was one of the people in Italy, where we wanted to show people like Sambias, how food is being built.
We came to Southeast Southeast Italian seed, into this shagging valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population to grow Italian tomatoatoes and zchini.
Of course, the local authorities had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such a fertile province of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they don't make it, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Wait in time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had this amazing tomato tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the Sambers: "Look how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, over night, about 200 nilers came from the river and measured everything.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were an Italian man in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French world did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We used to put on the nilers at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we have not let the world's best African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, she's a geological economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the world's nomadic countries 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money did.
Just read their book.
So think about a African woman, what we did.
We humans are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I devoured every other culture as though they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronishening: I suffer every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "bwana," called boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "malliful" by singing laughter, and he said, most importantly in the economic development, if people don't want to help, let them stay.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who set up this conference, a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that is not neococronial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I created a system called business promotion, where nobody is ever being initiated, nobody is going to be motivated, but you're going to become the service of the local talent, the local talent of the people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit down with a local local community.
We're not working on offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to find friends's relationships and find what the person wants.
The most important thing is that passion is.
You can give somebody an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for the life of the person's growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this one trap: Why, instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have an expert in education, and they never will say publicly what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunity.
You know, planning has this blink.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We work to one to do this, to make it, we need to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
There's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the village doctor of the company, the school doctor of the company, who is sitting in the house with you, on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources to change your passion in a way that will change your life.
I tried this in vitileity, West epidemics,
I was doing some research on time, trying to get out of the blurry, where we tell others what to do, what to do.
And so I was walking through the streets for the first year, and within the first three days, my first client, and I helped him, and he was a kid in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth and he started organizing, and the fishermen came and said, "You had helped the Maii?" Can you help us help us get a restaurant in a restaurant?
I helped these five fishermen work together, and this wonderful tuna not to sell to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per hour, but to Japan for 40-dollar dollars sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us?" Can you help us?"
I had been walking 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk>" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- So the government says, "Cake it again."
We did it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the start of this.
There's a new generation of companies that go on loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printing professor was a philosophy professor before he was involved in companies. Peter's printer said, "Cake is really incompatible with a social society and economics."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest man Christchurchard wants to do with their money and their energy.
You need to learn how to get them to get you.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people who have the intelligence and passion?
For what presentation did you most have been paying for tomorrow?
<unk>Cear, passionate people. You applaud them.
I want to say to you that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- decisurable fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The burn machine is not sustainable.
The Freon Art of state is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, build, transport them and then interrelate them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
It will be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in the year in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and they were able to speculate what would happen in the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if citizens continue to grow in that pace, they needed six million horses to attract people to, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd go under the crap.
In 1860 they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, they have to be offered discourse.
They don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is you have to provide them absolute, committed, passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all have to be able to perform three things: that we need to be a commercial product, great-grandcios, which is great, and the financial authorities must be enormous.
So guess what?
We never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
This is not something that exists.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world are related to, one thing: no one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16 students in North Korea entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them to give them the first two pages of Richard Bransons Philography, and the job of the 16 American is to support two sides of Richard Bransographic Autobiography as often as the word "weel" and how often the word "weeds."
Never "ich" and 32 times as we can."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who has a small, small company in the cafes and Bars, and their creative buddy, who are going to do what someone has done for this gentleman who talks about this subject, and someone who talks to you, "What do you need?"
What can you do? You can make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you believe somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting companies to help them find the means of the resources and the people, and we've found that the wonders of the public health of the population can be transformed by the economy and the economy of that community, just by the beginning of the passion and energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be, that Alice must be in the miracle country.
Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- asking engineers to give them education.
I was scared.
I'm afraid of fear. For those students with their large brains and their large books and their big, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation came together, it started to me like Alice, when she went down to the case of a pinex and saw a door in a whole new world.
And I felt like I was having conversations with the students, and I was amazed to think about the thoughts they had, and wanted others to discover this wonder country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go anywhere. I think it's in our responsibility as a scientist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you some of the ways that you can make it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to us is, what is it?
Let's tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us right now.
It's not just that you're looking at your clothes, but also tell us that their clothes, the plastic structure in our bones, are investigating, because it's important to understand and treat osteoposis.
And if you describe what you're doing, then you're making it illegal.
In arguments, there's a barrier to understanding your mind.
Certainly, you could use your tidy and time and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more intuitive for us?
We're going to understand your thoughts, it's not the same as they're going to pick up their level.
As Einstein said, "Forget things as easily as possible, but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, a couple of things about this is to look at examples, stories and analogies. So in this way, you can pull us into your boss.
And when you present your work, you'll take the spots away.
Have you ever asked, why does it mean "Ere point?"
What happens when somebody else is looking at? Another one is going to be stabged, and with those points, the first person you're going to meet your audience.
A slide like this is not only boring, but also it also also also fits to a very good part of the conversation about our brain, and by doing so, we're rapidly challenged.
This example of Gene Berve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it actually was the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence where the audience can lose, once it loses the thread, print images and graphics that also encourage our other senses and make a deeper understanding of what it is that they describe.
These are just a couple of ways that can help us open up those towers and see the wonders of the country that compelled science and technology.
Since the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to make the <unk>the<unk> in me" in a narrow way, I want to sum up all the way with a equation.
So if you look at your science and your paper words, you can share that through the relevance, and so the audience tells you what's important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work. And that's what you can do with incredible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you have solved this equation, they're really going to be in touch with me.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a drug with a phone, you can film a crime in the human race.
You can take a cell phone and you can dial a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, upload it on soundoud, be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I am a year of 1997, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time. Let's go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who came out and asked change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Hold your cell phones up, hold them up!
Hold it up. an Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everyone has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Pounds of raw data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. embassy has set up a policy line.
This is a policy line called the National Assortional Act.
This key is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe, every single consumer information system has to store a whole range of user information.
Who calls who? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service providers.
And all over Europe, people have been up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this protection system.
We want to have self-determination in digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were racing on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Fake out fear."
And some even said this could be on Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Limpneydizei in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is it really working?
Can all this information really store us about?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Price Teleject, who was then the biggest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, I'm going to send all the information that saved you.
And I once asked her, and I asked her, and I couldn't get a right answer. Just a smaller Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's happening with it.
So I decided to put a court trial against it because I wanted to have that information.
But the German post said no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end of it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to take back the testimony of what they're going to send me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court trial decided that the introduction of E.U. embassy was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown stripet with a CD.
And on the CD, that was this.
35830 lines of information.
I first saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My commute.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is protective control.
So with time and online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to get to C<unk>nn, and how many calls I'm going to run.
All of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of a fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just calling my wife and she calls me, and we're talking to each other a couple of times.
And then a couple of friends call me up and they call them to each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call them, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to who is going to send an email to who is going to be, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said in the beginning, we imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in the Germany in 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might have never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall might have not happened.
And also, not the case of the icy of the curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information about how they can get over us, online and space.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for that every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an issue of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're going to tell your bosses, just because companies and government places have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Cortional autos, rapid-diving restaurants, Brakakak spaces.
So the city plan is going to come and think about changing the name of South Central so that it stands for something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles as if something is changing what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Tortional stores, rapid-diving restaurants, bureaucracy.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-by and the Drivebys.
The comic is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a preventable condition.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't do that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, if you see the negative effects that the existing food system has on your neighborhood.
I realize that skier chairs are bought and sold like use of use.
I see dialogue centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't like to feel like I was five-minute-minute-to-minute-day-day-day-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-a-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-a-a-be-be-a-a-a
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park park.
It's 45 feet to three feet.
The thing is, it's in the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to stay in."
And I decided to keep it in there.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started to plant my food heat and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a pre-medits group, put together by gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, and it's completely voluntary and all we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then somebody complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically shared a favor car, and said, I need to remove my garden, the waiting car was a compelling impact.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
A narrative of mandates for growing food on a piece of land that you're totally not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her Her name."
Because this time it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times had wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city Council and a member of Green Ground Ground. They signed a petition on Change.org, and with 900 regulations we succeeded.
We thought we were going to be a victory in our hands.
My townmate even called up and said that they support it and love what we do.
So why should they not do that?
LA. In the United States, most of the palms in the property of the city.
They own 67-kilometer-square-foot-touch spaces.
This is 20 Central Parks.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell they shouldn't find it OK?
You get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds from the crop of a plant.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my lunch hero, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of these pre-visible worlds that have been made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Sort work is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, a wall-lounding, I'm going to make lawns and sanitation.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my own measures for these kinds of stuff.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth's soil can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've seen my garden as an instrument of education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how children would be influenced by it.
Sorters are the most therapeutic and humiliative act you can do, especially in the city.
You also get strawberry strawbers.
I remember that time that mother and daughter came, it was about 10:30 a night. They were in my garden, and I came out and I looked at them like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason in the street."
I was ashamed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just forced me to do that, and people asked me, "Fin, you don't know that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye hell, no, I'm not scared that they're squeaking.
It's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to buy the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it had planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it was only for a moment.
Green grassts have already planted about 20 gardens of gardens.
And when we went to our reform programs, 50 people came and did it, and those are all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoatoes.
But if they don't get anything from it, if they don't get to see how food and body affects, they're blind, whatever you're putting them on.
I see young people who want to work, but they're in this thing -- I see color-touch kids who are exactly on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere else.
I think of the gardeners as a chance of working on these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth's soil, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole apartment in gardens of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take ship carts and turn them into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails because free is not sustainable.
The cometic of sustainability is that you have to stop it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the joy and the honor, when you build your own food, and when you open farmers markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gamingers.
We need to turn the image of a weather switch around.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You get a big deal with the doggy, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me when you sit down in smart chairs and want to make a meeting where you talk about it, you know, you know, you're going to write some of them.
If you want to meet me, come with your skip, into my garden so that we can plant any scars.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English is "nollynnvoster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
Andnollygoster means "the unhealthy politicians."
Even though a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Snollyjoster is somebody who is planning a post-picture, independent of side, program or program or program, and success, and success by the pure power of the monumental elusion."
I have no idea what a paper word is.
Some of them, I think, in words.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, for example, were given according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not the exact word "wugs of debates."
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who moved to Parliament.
They threw it in the London Tower and gave it a little bit of it, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to reframish, and then finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first criteria for the sentence "so" is so strong as Brass." Many believe.
And then you have to look at the English word for lifts.
But that's not true. It's not about a convicted of the press freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States, at the time when it's reached independence.
You were looking at the question of, how to call George Washington, the head of the head.
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
In Congress, there has been a long debate about this for an infinite time.
And there were all kinds of ideas that were worth making possible.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-val George Washington, and then others, the regulations of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's not that comfortable.
Some people just wanted to name it king.
They thought that was needed.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this unlaced, because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the journal of a Norwegian who always writes, "Wait the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the long-lived thing was that the representatives department was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be worthy. They didn't want to make it.
King call it, and maybe it may be on ideas about it, and it might be on his after.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most serenous title that they could think of.
This title was "Pice."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that somebody was signing a gathering.
Something like the preference of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the term "wart" or "visious water."
Sometimes there were little prime president of major groups and government groups, but it was really an unconvenited title.
So the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it president.
This guy has to sign and make foreign people want to vote.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And also, after three weeks of debate, the Senate had not been there.
Instead, you don't want to think of the word "Pountice" as a word, but they were going to have absolutely clear that they were not supposed to be honest about their respect for the opinions and civil institutions, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's an assault that the head of the state is a credibility of the state -- not necessarily valid to the president's opinion of the other people who are in the United States.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First of all, and I find that best -- until now I can't find out if the Senate ever confirmed the title of the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just faked the title. He just waits the fact that the Senate is active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something temporary is -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the world's largest economy and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and history have given the title of size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
You've got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the opposite of self-hood -- well, it was like that.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate won, and the representative house hospital was lost because no one feels humbling when you're told that you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I can leave with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually words change much more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a board with about 50 rebellion in the fight of Mr. Teszler'sold year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I painted my black Conclight Matchows against a pair of brown leather-and-dipped and dried a rocket towards the government authorities I couldn't even see.
This was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had become a big war, but next to Pyjama party and football games at Samschards and commanders and commute with racist-American protesters who never lived with communism and lived for Afghanistan and revival the knowledge of what I knew was that.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I stand here today, born Afghane, South-states of God Gnnesty, and an atheist and a radical political artist who lived in Afghanistan for the last nine years, and created.
So there are lots of great things in Afghanistan about the art of art, but I personally don't like to paint rain shows. I want to make art that motivates people and authority and re-expligate reality and actually use a kind of a kind of a kind of a creative experience to try and understand the world that we're in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- Worlddegese who is teaching his jihad to be a communist like "Pop Starbling" and used armed religious deliberation and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can the jihad do when the parliament is to do the job and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I doing jihad?" And I'm rich."
And to try to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi to be used as national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, and I want to go to a project called "Rearse," where you give yourself a cop to build a false control system on the streets of Kabul and use cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, provide money, and give them money to the police in Kabul, and the police in Kabul, I hope that they will take us a hundred dollars from Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the "modest conflict."
The war and the strange views that came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to train local farmers' mouths with a protected and multiple incoherent or a re-friendly, vigo-friendly vigual design.
And I'd like to see what a simple pointer of Kabul looks like in the 18th-991 Appellau's app to create a dialogue about today's development institutions, their origins in the past colonial rhetoric about the White White House to protect the man's brown man in themselves and maybe even a little bit of a civilized way.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, you can misunderstood them, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
This is my burden. What is your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, it was said, right?
I felt that now, there was a very uncomfortable tension in the room, because I shouldn't have been able to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little more time to turn on this.
This is the first time someone is raising up on the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happy thing to see.
If a couple of women were really upset when I came out, you don't need to tell me this, I read it on Twitter later.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
It's not everybody who has the chance.
These elevations are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater above my head, because then you're going to all be fired out of me, so you don't do anything until it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not that I'm not going to be so uncomfortable as this image.
A image is powerful, but a image is also a shallow.
I just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this image -- I had never had a friend in fact.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I should use my back oil and fit with my hand in the hair of this guy.
And beyond the surgery or the wrong thing that I took up two days ago for work, there are very few ways to change our utterances, and our expressions are -- even the shallow and ineffective -- a big impact on our lives.
To be fear is to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is this legacy?
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical in the image of wonder that we're biologically programmed but also as big, sharp, feminist and brighter.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionmakers might call, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smalls. Liu."
And first, I'm going to comment on your model of model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm afraid that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that have counted on the length of the day, each one that was consumed, and that 677 segments were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always been asked to me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown?"
And first I reply, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is, why?
You know what? You can do anything.
You can become President of the United States or be the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja psychiatric miracle, which would be absolutely wrong, because then you'd be the first one."
If they still say this amazing counter-macting, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Am my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the business leader of H<unk>amp;MM or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's as if you want to get the Jack 101 to win the pie in Lotto.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a product of design, because unlike a heart surgeon, it can only escape itself.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," now the leg goes first, and long and long, and that arm goes back to the back, and on the back of the head is three-quarters, and you just move back and you just go back and you see, you're going to have a six-dimensional friends, 300 times, and you
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that, in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and have a life walk, and a few jobs, you can't say much more. If you say that you want to be president of the United States, but you're going to be in life, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Am all the photos going to release?"
And yes, as much as all the photos are being stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I wore a Bikini. I hadn't even had my period.
I know this will be quite personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw a couple of months earlier, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this drawing.
My girlfriend had to come and join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a Shinting for French bird.
This is me with the football team and the New Yorker magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not pictures of me.
They're constructors, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and Makeup and animators and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the adoption and development. They're not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "What's wrong with them?"
Yes, I have too many 20-mix-cunk shoes that I can't wear except just, but the things I get free are things that I get in real life and don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and you gave me the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light light light, and of course, we were stopped. It took a confession: "Excuse me, Mr. Winner Words," and we could go on.
I got these costless things because of my appearance and not because of my personality and there are people who pay for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and shot last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It lives in New York only 17,000 young, male and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I going to be stopped?"
In my research for this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13 year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number goes up to 78 percent if they've become 17 percent.
The last question I'm asking is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting that answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and a little shiny hair, you feel very happy and wonderful."
And then, back days, we give an answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never tell from the camera, which I never said before in front of the camera, is, "I feel unsafe."
And I feel safe because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had a little, skinny legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some of the modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most disgusting hair and the coolest flakes, and they are probably the ones that look at their appearance, probably, uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to pull me up a more honest balance, and I felt very uncomfortable with that, and I felt like, "I got all the benefits from a pile of mine that was being sucked up in my favor," and it doesn't feel very good to add, "And I don't always feel happy."
It was very difficult to open up a heritage of violence and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to be here, and I'm really honored to stand here, and I find it's great that before I've reached 10 or 20 years, and I've never been a career, because I'd probably not say what I was going to get my first job, or maybe I'd not say, I'd be paid to be as a college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our compulsive failures and misconceptions.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, Gaddafafi Resistance. Celece it.
But never will be a bit like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been almost two years since the Libby revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass-paying events both in the Tunisian and Egyptian revolution.
I would connect with many other Libyers, within and outside of Libyens to challenge a day of anger and start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gadaffis.
And there it was, a big revolution.
Boy, Victorian women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown excellent courage by asking themselves against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity from the east to the far east, to the south.
After a period of six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 deaths, we managed to free our country and to eradicate the tyranny.
Gaddafi has left a great brush, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the pathal.
Over four decades, Gaddafis Viharmonic regimes have destroyed both the infrastructure, and also the cultural and moral structure of the eyvic society.
The destruction and the challenges, I've known how many other women can rebuild society's society, Lybania, and we asked a participatory and well-intentioned transition to democracy and nationalism.
Oloquans of 200 organizations, and immediately after Gaddafis, in Benghazi, have started, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybia, and with unique enthusiasm, I started working video games to organize human development and leadership skills.
I started a team of women with a wonderful women's peacebuilding platform, a movement of women, leaders from different lives, whose goal is to enter public health, public preservation, and to help women, to the right, to the right, to the right, to the responsibility of democracy and to democracy.
In the elections, I met in a very difficult environment, a environment that has been expanding more and more intense. A environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and assurance.
I led a initiative to the Peace Movement of Great Bey's Women to achieve a participatory choice law, a law that anyone in the country, no matter what the background should be, and to vote for a law, and to address, mainly for political parties, a female and female, on a vertical and horizontal level, and to make a complete match.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the national justice workers in the first elections for 52 years.
But it was very clear, the euphoria of elections and the whole revolution after <unk> because every day we were taking new messages of violence.
A morning, we started to commute the ban of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of American ambassador and attack for the message.
And then, one morning, the murder rate of the armed forces were signed by the armed forces.
And really, every day, we were facing the sovereignty of the military and their ongoing challenges against human-pived civilized and their dissonance of laws and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they had initially argued.
Intolerance, and riff, became the icons of the F<unk>Furime era of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you with the success of our ability and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, who have made false choices and wrong choices.
We set our priorities wrong.
Because the elections were not going to bring peace nor security or security in Lybia.
Have the appropriate and the change between women and men's rights and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate and dominate the political of dominance and the unreliation, both men and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only thing that missed that, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the unus.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus when it took the elections, which has only empowered polarization and fragility.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop doing the name of anger and ask a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that is not only recommending the values, but also to confuse: Goffade instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than unfinished.
These are the ideals that are desperate to achieve one of the war-sreated lybacia to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in those alchemia, it's about the rejuvenation of feminine and masking view.
That's the real compliance.
And that's what we need to do in particular, before we do it in sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran "Salam," "The word of the Good God, rally."
And then the word "ravem," which is known in all the late-ravinal traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rajecture" and symbolized the mother's mother's homaline, which is all around the human race, and the female and the female and the tribes of all have been hit.
And just like the mother's assaulting the embryo that grows in him, completely surrendered the basic body of empathy all of the existence.
And so we're told, "My Gnade is going to give all of these things."
So we've been told, "My Gnade has a pre-deted pre-defay in front of my grall."
We all want to enjoy the gi of the gist.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we pioneered the story of Kim Klung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole change moment.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was poor, and I never had to suffer from starvation.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me from my father's sister.
It said, "If you were sitting here, our five family members will not be on the planet because we hadn't eaten for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard that for the first time that people in my country were suffering.
In short, I went through the station station and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A blind woman stood on the ground, and a handled kid in her arm was flawed with his mother's face.
But no one helped them because everyone was busy doing so well, caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'0s, there was a great famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million Northern Irelandans were sick of famine, and many more people survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree cortex.
So traffic accidents have been more and more common, so at night, everything was going to bother me at night, except the lights of China on the other side of the user's search that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we don't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Ambs, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very narrow, and it enables North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated by my family for a short time.
I never thought it took me 14 years to revive himself.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea how life would be like North Koreans, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Koreans are going to see refugees in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly flying, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught in the Chinese police department and was sent to the police department.
Somebody was propelled to be Northern Koreans, so they tested my Chinese habits and asked me countless questions.
I was so scared, I thought I would explode my heart.
So dignity seems to be somewhat unnatural, I could be locked down and signed.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the question, a lawyer said to the other, "That was a falcon.
She's not a Northstorean."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are searching for foreign messages like Asyl, but many are caught and signed by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they finally released out of enormous international pressures.
These North Koreans had so much luck.
Every year, there are countless Northern Koreans being caught in China and are arrested by North Korea where they were tortured or imprisoned or publicly.
Even though I was lucky at escape, there's not a lot of other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, the world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of doing this, I decided to go to South Korea and I started a new life.
I was blown down in Southern Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I had.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
I also saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been in a very divergence of each other, because of 67 years of the division.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I South or Northstorean?
Where am I coming? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Even though my adaptation on the south-dominated life didn't really fall, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording testaries at university.
Just as I was more committed to my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Kadan authorities started to take the money I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to reshape, to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to give back an incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me go to the north-Katan border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all of these, and started asking questions.
Since my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I was determined, and he said that they were suicidal, and I was her boss.
He looked at me in a disturbing way, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to make it up to the lavic border, but I had to almost search for all my money to make the boundary control of Laos.
But even after we've gone across the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border transition.
After I paid money and bribes, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest confession of my life.
I had done everything I could to protect my family to liberty, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Korean Embassy.
I went and I went to the immigration of immigrants and the police department, and I tried to desperately liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money to pay money or money back to cash.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that there was a foreignity about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and no to complain about a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other Northern Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about my very heart and I asked, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Bronx people help."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, for me, symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but freedom is only a step.
Many Northern Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start with little money or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea turn out.
I was so lucky to get as much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to make hopeful North Koreans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful Northern Koreans all over the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good sight.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He discouraged them, and he divided them away.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, sometimes to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate cake, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first episode of the teapies on my arm was to have been punched on my arm and Lady Gagas birthday.
Don't they listen to it incredibly?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged and strengthened my soul was that although that was the case, even though they were not considered common, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "authorism," it's a complex activity of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's very different in each individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, 20 minutes of autism is noticed, and while it's one of the fastest growing organisms in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm being in autism, but I can't remember it for a day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the same way that the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, and putting the washing machine in there and eating everything that was coming out of it.
And as it became older, it became different, and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustles and the never-dominated hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had otherwise been.
Amazing.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments where I wished they were just like me.
But I go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Ordinaryity is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance of scale, progress, and change die in the moment that we try to find out how someone else is.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Ed Negropon has been filled with awe and curiosity with this photo on a project that we took an apple and a half a second of a time of a time in-life.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion-trillion-second images.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-A photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can make time-lapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that are going to look at the outside of our perspective, or we can't see a <unk>-ray in our bodies and really ask what we mean with "Mamera" my camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I light it in a billionth of a second -- this is several Femtoseconds -- I make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter-sized, and this photonodile, this project will move into speed, and, as I said, a million times a second, a second-larged project.
So if you take this project, take this satellite package and shoot it into that bottle, how do these photons break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So, think about this, the whole event is actually taking less than a nanotipone -- so long as light takes to get back this lane -- but I'm going to highlight this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, in this film, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon package, which starts to move through and melt the inside.
Part of the light is flowing out of the table outside, and you see this spread of waves.
A lot of the photons eventually achieve the imception of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's influated around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves go out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back the same path and slow the video back to the factor 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
One day, one week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, regular project of motion.
And what about a little still-lapse photograph?
You can see again, how these waves are streaming around the table, the Tomces and the wall in the back of the background.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature would paint a photo like this, each of the time a Femto-A image, but of course, our eye is a single image of a single.
But if you look at these Tomces, you'll see that when the light is streaming over, it's going to keep that dark.
Why is this? Because the Tomel is coming, and the light jumps around you, and after a few billion seconds, it's coming back.
So in the future, if this teto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket and find out if an fruit is closed, not even touching it.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a photo of a short-term, you have very little light, but we have a billion times faster than your shortest ventilation process, so you don't get as much light at all.
So what we're doing is we're going to send this project, this photon package, a million-fold, and we're going to draw this back and forth with very clever synchrony, and we're going to combine this mega-through data and we're going to make this thing that we've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and make very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercompaniar: Can they see corners?
The idea is that we light a little bit on the door.
It's going to be decoupling, go into space, some of it will be reflected back on the door, and finally, back to the camera, and we could use these more magnifular magnifrial measures of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
Behind the wall is a soup hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in theNature Communications, it was taken out of Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to take this light project and we're going to push it on this wall and we're going to push it back into this wall, and this photon package is going to be dragged back into all directions, and some of the photons will be able to break our hidden soup, and then then the door will then reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons of the photons will come back to the camera, but they're going
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time-solving solution, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance from the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by clicking on a laser, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but if we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and then we try to analyze the different light-controlled light, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering process.
We have a little bit more to do before we can put this in the lab, we could build cars that are out of collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous fires, by looking at light, and we can see the open window, or we can build the endcopeo in the body, and we can see the right powder and castecrosopes around the wall.
But because of the human and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, so that's really a term call for scientists, now think about Femto-A photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edruon, even a scientist, the science has become an art of an ultra-speed art, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, not only the scientific image process, but we can also create a new form of computer photography with paint, and we can look at color-thrill, and we can just look at the timeline between that wave of time.
But it also seems a little bit fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're almost in light speed, we've got weird effects, and Einstein would have liked this image incredibly.
And the sequence that happens in events in the world appear in the camera in a more walk-down order, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So, no matter if you want to focus around photography or to create a new visualization tool for medicine or new forms of design, since we've been able to open all the data and details on our website and hope that the Cheetators, the creative and the research community, we should stop to get to the megelels of the next quadometer and the next-dimensional imagery.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can make our lives better for people like our lives.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that a lot of deliberations don't get passed on, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and valves and crosses and crosses.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free homes so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being re-red by the great oily, which has been insulted for hundreds of years, loving, drunk, drunk and woolly, and I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time someone ever knows, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city of most missing worms in America.
I live near this house and I thought about how I can make it happen, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it made me clarity of the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to get into that view every day.
It's easy to lose and forget what's really important in your daily lives.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned one side of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote with a treck of the blankbat, "I will die," I want to give everybody a piece of chalk, and I could be able to think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I want to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"On I die, I want to stand on a full-time conclusion about the International World Cup."
"On I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"On I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die, I want to live in green."
I wish I'd die, I want to keep it back in my arms."
"On me to die, I want to be somebody's cavramra."
"On I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding them in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space forums and thinking and remembering what's most important as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction box, and now in the world, in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public places when we have the opportunity to move our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of over-reasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often being held by talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the most powerful things that strengthen us.
And the idea of death is that it gives us life.
Our common places show us what's important as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I work with a related math problem, a special problem for anyone who is involved in a related mathematics, is that we are like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the horror of the fordorious ballet and the swists, as you'll see.
So the ballett is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it possible with my fellow-fled Jan Abriosition, who was a ballet memory at the time.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
But nevertheless, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to have to have the unfortunate symptoms like weaknesses, trephility, serenity and others who live that cause this disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know if there is a cure, if we have an objective metric that can answer that question.
Now, in trouble, there's no biomarkional activity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside of clinical trials is never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could make this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a expensive hospital staff.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to go into the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional way that we try to achieve that, because we're all at least virtual, virtuable like my-duupleuary Rulple.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal sound.
This is what happens in a healthy state when someone is creating speech sounds, we can look at ourselves as a coherent ballet dancer, because we need to coordinate all these vocal organs when we make noises, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And like ballet, it requires a huge practice.
Think about how long a child needs to take to speak until it's learning.
And by the way that sound, we can actually define the position of the vibrant vocal odor, and just like the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the opposite-tolerance sound-sensitive sound-tolerance.
We see the same symptoms always.
True, weakness, weakness, eternity.
The language is going to be self-driving and fuzzy, and that's an example of it.
And this impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision data analysis, combined with new machine-based learning that's now advanced, we can now see where someone is in a space of disease and health, just because of the sounds of the voice.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test of neurologists.
It's also little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are accurate. They're not going to be conducted by experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very, very quickly, at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
And we can do these amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logististic difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine plans in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through frequent observation.
We can do low-cost mass care for clinical trials and allow the first time to have a study of the entire population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Today, we're going to take this way into this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's Law Initiative.
With Aculab and PatientLikeMe, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough input data for the success of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can be called cheaply to leave video clips for a few cents, and I'm known to be blessed with the fact that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you're going to go out and say, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can tell who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the phone has to tell if this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be made until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting, because these conditions are important, because we are able to use them to detect what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, it has 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to blame it because he did such a fantastic job -- has shown that it also works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we are at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
So people can -- people can call the phone with the phone and make the test. People could call it with Parkinson's voice so they can check the problem of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back of the back, you see my father's cows, and that's behind the kitchen of Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is only in the South, so that means that wild animals like zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found them dead. It was our only bumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we would come together with our animals and the Sortlife of the sky, so our animals care so much.
I learned to be a kid when I was a kid to hate lions.
Our warrior, Morans, they protect our tribe and our ancestry. They are also on this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why there are only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is responsible between six and nine years for his father's cows. That's what it was for me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that it wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't go. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's book.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow's table.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird search and you go back, but the next time they come, and you say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I took the Stall. I walked around with a tap in the hand, and this time, the lions did not interrupt.
Anter is afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room for a little boy all day, and I was actually taking the new radio apart from my mother, and the day it almost took me around, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy station from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn it on the right or left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and turn it off.
This is a little pear of a broken flap lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar elephant is providing the battery, which is providing the battery to the power of the action. I call it a transformer.
And the right ingredient is blind.
You see that the halves are pointing outwards, because there are lions coming from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are blinking, and the lions believe that I'm going around the wreck, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been in our home with this, and since then, we've had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including for other predators, like hyena or leopard, and the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms.
My invention took me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is involved and helps to deliver donations and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there is no other, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
One year ago, I only had a boy from the savanna who was praying from his father's cows, and I looked at airplanes on me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of my day!"
And here I am, now.
I was invited to draw a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a airplane engineer and a pilot. This is my great dream.
I used to make lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can bring the lions together. We can go together, side, side with lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Oln means this in my language: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
My next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrozception?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own own.
You've tried it, you've tried it, right -- yeah, I've tried to do it again, but I've given the attempt to get back because I had a -- a stroke.
First of all, Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We are going to be feeding you every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
For me, I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and no one of them I did.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture again, not even the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by randomly-discovered tourists.
My story begins when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this image where I gave my daughter to her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
So just a year later, we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see what this is going on --
When my daughter's third birthday came closer, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do it a father-child race to lead the ritual?"
At that time, we started asking me to ask, you know, walk-up tourists, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to take a complete stranger and you're going to take your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been touched with our camera.
At that time, we didn't know how much those travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11 and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a coincidence moment or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October for a week, to think about our time and how we change ourselves from year to year, not just physically, but in all.
Because while we're always doing the same image, our view of time changes as time as it always moves, as it's always reached new milestones, I can see the life with their eyes, how it's dealing with everything, and how it sees it.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something that we value and expect for every year.
Last, while one of our trips, we went for a walk, and all of a sudden, they kind of collapse like this, and it shows a red mark on a vet of a puppet, which was a little kid, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old at this point.
She said that she remembered her heart of her chest when she first saw the store for nine years ago.
And now, it's looking at New York to high school schools because it's really important to study in New York.
And I realized, in a way, the most important thing that we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with this image and don't you mind asking someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
