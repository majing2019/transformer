When I was 11 years old, I became a morning of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the paper.
My father heard on his little, gray radio showers of the BBC.
He looked very happy about what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was very popular about the news.
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but I did my father, very happy.
"Now, you can go to a right school," he said, "Yes."
This morning, I'm never going to forget.
A right school.
The Taliban's power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they're treated girls to go to school.
So I was able to get my five years old than a boy and my older sister who didn't have to be able to get a secret school.
And so we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way to know that nobody could predict where we went.
We're looking at our books in a car, so we'd look like to go and go.
We're going to be in a house, about 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a bit cold, but it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were having our lives, teachers, students, students, students, our parents.
Again, again, the conversation had to be out of the classroom for a week, because the Taliban had to get the first.
We never knew how much they knew about us.
Are they aware of success?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a lot of lucky time to grow up in a family that was more important than education and daughters.
My grandfather was far beyond his time.
A seder of a local war in Vietnam, and he was his daughter -- my daughter -- my mom -- and she became a school, and she was forced to his father.
My mother became a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to the prison, just to move our house to school and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here -- the first one was the first family that had ever received a education.
And it was always clear that his children would get a education, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as much greater risk to send their kids to school.
I know exactly what I was so frustrated in the Taliban, and sometimes the fear of our lives, from the unconcession and the view of the performance.
I was feeling good, sent to the driver, but my father said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose your life.
Your money can win, you can be released from your house.
But one of the things that you're going to stay in here is what's inside there, and even if we need to pay our blood care for your lunch school, we need to do that.
So -- you want to give you a little bit of it?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was lost by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women's women's women's women who have a higher-term age, and when my family didn't have been so much so much so much so hard for my education for my education, I would have been able to do with a women.
But instead, I'm standing here, like a nice-time student of the New Yorker School.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was arrested by his family, because he had his daughters to send his daughters to school, the first one that I was interested in.
He's not just about my college school, but also that I was the first woman who's going to drive it through the car with Beijing.
My family thinks.
I have big dreams, but my family has always bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global international international campaign for 1011111111 dollars of education for women.
So I decided to build MOTTT, and maybe the first student for girls, a country in Afghanistan, a country that is still more effective for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students are doing with high-tech skills that they want to know all the people.
And to see how their parents and fathers are a bit of their father, and as my parents, and despite all the time, and against all the other.
So, like Robert, that's not really a name, and I can't show his face, but Robert is the father of my students.
About a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home of MOTTT, and they are out of a bomb on the street, and they are just about a month of a few minutes.
When he went home, the phone got a voice and a voice he would go to him, if he got his daughter to school, she would try to try again.
And he said, "I want to leave you now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter's own friend because of your old and unconpooding and thought."
What's going on in Afghanistan, so I realized something that's going to be often in the West, and I think, is that the success of us, the success of us, a father, a father, the value, and that is that his daughter is going to recognize that it's success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers don't play a very important role in our success.
In fact, they're often often more likely to get more and more interested in their own future-term future, but in a society like Afghanistan, and in Afghanistan, the support of the poor support of the women.
The Taliban went to the Taliban only few thousand girls in school -- because it was illegal.
But now, in Afghanistan, three million girls are the school bank.
Afghanistan seems like the world, as different as that.
Americans recognize how valuable these changes are.
I don't know that the changes are not from long-term and they're changing the U.S. military.
But when I see the students in Afghanistan, and their parents who are trying to use their parents, and then I see a very promising future and a long-term future.
Afghanistan is part of a country of hope and the unconventable opportunities, and remember me every day, the girl who go to MOO.
And as I did, they have great dreams.
Thank you very much.
Everything I do, I think, I've been born with my life -- from seven years of work in Africa, as young man.
In 1977, 1977, I see young, but I'm not -- I'm -- I'm -- Kenya, Kenya, Bolivia, Bolivia, Bolivia, and Somalia, with the tech projects of developing African countries.
I worked for a Italian Life program, and every single project that we thought was failed.
I was safe.
I thought, 21 years ago, we thought that Italy is a good good job in Africa, and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything that we've been doing.
So, first project, what my first book was called "Rad" in Tah", one of the things that we wanted to show in Italy, in Italy, we wanted to show people like food.
We came to Italian-American plant in South America, and in this cold, which is what the Sami Islands is, we're studying the local population of the Asian and Italian Monam and Pellon.
Of course, the local community had no interest, so we put it for work, and sometimes they started to go.
We were amazed that there was no mass of a low-scale agriculture.
But instead of asking, why don't they put it together, we said, "Oh, thank God, we're here!"
"Tould you even save people's way to save the people's Sahahia."
And of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this great cowic system, Italy, they were so large, in Sambia, so big.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, like agriculture is just sustainable."
When the slime mold was red and red, over 200 days, they came out of the river and the river.
We said, "Oh, God, the pest!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why did you say, "You never asked us."
I thought, I was so good at Italy, but then I saw the Americans who did what the French English was doing, and then I saw what the French cow did, and then I saw what I was really proud about in our project.
We're doing the pestps at least.
You should see the bad, you should see the wrongness that we don't have to see the common African African people.
You should read the book "a-a-a-a-a-a-Sooooo, she's a super-profit scientist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent of a year-sillion billion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been done.
Just reading their book.
Think about a African man who we've been studying.
We are Western people, the Arab, colonists, mission, and there are only two species like we deal with people. We are our neocic or non-foody.
Both words are from the Latin-cent-like root, which means "Pat" means "wat."
But they have two different meanings.
Conconventical, I'm going to make each other's life, as they're my children. "I love you so much."
Rususus is what I do is I would make a different culture than they were my brother.
So, the white people in Africa are called "woody," the boss,
I was shocked to read the book "Bear" "B" read "B"" and he said, especially in economics, if people don't want to want to go back and even at the end of the time.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of the help is respect.
Now, tomorrow, the Mr.K. who was doing this conference, a press on the ground, and asked, "Can you imagine a city that doesn't exist?"
When I was a young age old, I decided to respond to people, and we decided to get a system called a company called a company that never has to be used, you know, you will be able to be able to make a tool, but you're going to be able to be able to get a local local, the local, the local man who has a better person to get a better person.
What you do is you make the mouth.
You never have a community of ideas, you get together with the local community.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafeteria. We're going to make us in K-B.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to see friends and find what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The secret for your own growth is the most important thing.
The secret for your own life is the most important thing of humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful.
The person with the idea, maybe the knowledge doesn't know, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this loss, instead of having a community and say, and people say, what do they do, why don't we hear them? But don't they go into the community?
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community-based communities.
Now, entrepreneurs never have a public public public, and they will never say what they want to do with their money, what they want to see.
To design, this is a completely-up.
The most popular people in the community don't know because they never seem to be able to know public meetings.
We work one to do this, a social infrastructure, that doesn't exist.
A new job has to be built.
This is the house of a professional company, the family of the company that you're sitting in your house, your lunch and in the cafeteria, helps you to find your passion, to change your passion in a way that is changing your life.
I've been doing this in the world, West, the West, trying to do.
I was doing it in time, and I tried to stop the cold-down, where we say, what they're going to do is to go.
And so I went through the streets of the street, and I had three days of my first clients. I got him in a garage, he was a restaurant, he was in a restaurant, and I got to get him to a restaurant, and she said, "You know, they're going to help you have the orangutan and they have helped us help us help us help us help us help us help us help you help you help you help us help you help you get the H
I spent this five fish, working together, and this wonderful glacier doesn't sell a factory in Hong Kong for 60 percent, but for high-a-a-a-a-N-S. and then they said, "Hey, you have helped us help us help us help us help us help us help us help us help us help us help you help us?"
In a year, I had a half-year-old projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very hard.
I feel the mouth and listen to them."
So -- -- -- so the government says, "Do you know, let's go again."
We've done it in 300 communities.
We've been helped 40 companies in the beginning.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to go through loneliness.
Peter Hillis, one of the best leaders of history, died with eight years ago.
Peter Hillis was philosophy before he started with companies, Peter Hillis said, "Triting is actually unconventable with a society and economics."
Office is the death of leadership.
So you build Mary's nose, without knowing what the most human man's most popular, with their money and their energy.
You need to learn how to get that one to get.
You have to give them a secret and privacy. You need to help them, and they have to help them, and they're going to get more sensitive.
In a community of 10 people, we're going to get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 10,000 people who are intelligence and creativity?
What you've been doing today today?
You know, you know, passionate, passionate, you know.
I want to say that entrepreneurs are the right way to say.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the more sophisticated fossil fuels, financial, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The failure engine is not sustainable.
The unconcession of the state of self-interest is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we can feed seven billion people in sustainable sustainable ways, build, build, build them, and then we can use them with them.
The technologies exist in the technology are not there.
Who will create this technology for the green revolution? universities? You're sorry!
The government? You stop!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a professional scientific magazine for many years ago.
There was a group of experts who invited to talk about the future of New York City in 18th.
In 18 and in 18, they came together and they started to get together, what would happen in the city of New York, and the result was that the first thing was, the city was a non-class city: New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve, and they said, when the population grows, they needed six million meals, and they needed to get the people who are impossible to get out of the box of six million of the fish.
Because they went out of the crap.
In 18, they see the dirty technology that's living from New York City.
What happens? Over 40 years later, 1981 dollars had 100 dollars -- 100 dollars -- 100 dollars.
The idea that a different technology has done was the race. There were little factories in the country.
Suny, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, first, they need to be paid by the unconpent.
And the most popular people don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, and creative services.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurs.
From the smallest, the most of the biggest company, all of the things that need to do is to sell three things: the product needs to sell the market, the market, the financial and the financial and the financial organization must be huge.
Do you know?
We never met a single person who can produce something that can sell the same time, and then they can sell money.
That's not something that doesn't exist.
This person never lived.
We've been looking at the research, and we've looked at 100 most of the most popular companies in the world -- TEDx, the Japanese, the U.K.K., the new companies, Google, Google, Google, Google.
There's only one of the successful companies that have ever been involved in the world, just one of them, was just built by one person.
Now, we teach the latest-year-old entrepreneur in North America, and we start to give them the class of Richard Brusics, and the next two sides of Richard Ciza, and the task is that the first year of the first year of the first year of the latest-old Coscica Foundation, and he's using the word "The Origin of Science" is often used to use the word "w" and often."
Never a "h" and 32 times."
He wasn't alone when he started.
No company built alone. No one.
So we can create a community in the leadership, which is a small community that sit in cafeteria and sit in cafeteria. Your loved sister, which is what someone else has done with this guy, and someone who says, "What you need to do about you?"
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you stop the money?"
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "Do you know, I think I think somebody else?"
We control communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping companies to help them find the tools and people who have found the idea of the social intelligence of the human society, and that the organization can change the culture of the society, and that the organization can also change the relationship between the physical and the physical and the physical and their imagination of their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've been studying how it should be, Alice has to be the miracle of the country.
The University University University of University asked me -- a Ph.S.D. with communication engineers, to cooperate.
I had fear --
All right. fear. Now, these students with their large brains, and their large books, and their big books, and their big words, I don't think.
But when the conversation was developed, he was asked to me how Alice was going down and saw a door and a door to a very new world.
I felt like, when I was a conversation with students, I was fascinated about the thought that they wanted to know, and they wanted to find that other miracle of the country.
I think to open the door, it requires great communication.
We need to change great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers, the most of our biggest problems, like the power and environmental and health, and if we know nothing about it, and it doesn't understand it, and it's not going to think that it's not going to be interested in our responsibility, because in our fears, in our science, not because of the science, in our scientists.
But these amazing conversations are not happening when our scientists and engineers don't tell us in their miracle.
So scientists and engineers, please, let's go.
I want to show you some of the tools that you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with you, sexy, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer us is, and what?
Now, let's say why your scientific field is so important for us.
Don't just think that their tears are read, but also tells us that their tears that are actually learning in our bones, because they're interested in our bones, because they're important to know, and they can learn to treat it, and they can learn to treat it.
And when you think about what they do, then they're doing, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Now, in the same term, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
Now, don't know what it might be a good and long-time and time, but why don't you say, "C" and time, what's very exciting for us?
We are going to make your thoughts to understand, not the same thing that you're going to do with the level of the level.
As Einstein said, "Too-shoo-shoo things like this, but not easier."
You can tell us something about your scientific field without having to deal with the workforce.
Some things are looking at the very common, examples, stories and cognitive and cognitive, and so that's the way that you can get in your hand.
And when you put your work, then let's take the dots away.
Have you ever asked you, why is it?
What happens when someone's going to do? Another other, and then you're going to get the first dots of your audience.
And I don't think about a slide like this, but it's just boring, but it's also very boring to talk about the very part of our brain, and that's what we're doing is that we're going to do quickly.
So this is a lot more powerful about genes, neurosberg is that the special structure of the body is so much so much so powerful that they actually have the inspiration for the symbol of the Codel.
The trick here is to use a single sentence, just to use a specific sentence that's going to lose the audience when you can lose the record, and then you can use the images, and then the visual images, and then the other way that makes the sense of what it means.
And these are just a few ways that help us open and see the door and the miracle of the world, the science and technology is going to be able to get into technology.
There's the engineers that I learned, I learned to make the "N" in my little bit, I want to make everything with a prediction.
And look at your science and your professional comments, and so the audience says, what's important, and then you know, you know, you know, the passion that you have the passion to your work, and you have this incredible work, and you have this incredible amount of information, and you can have this incredible information that you can do, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm really sure, I'm really sure.
Thank you very much.
Hi. That's my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
With a cell phone, you can read a crime in the human society in Syria.
You can start with a phone phone, and you can start a conversation in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get high-up-up-up-up-up-up and be famous.
All of that is possible with a cell phone.
I live in Berlin year, and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
You can see how thousands of people went to the street and put them out.
We are in the winter of 1988, and we're looking at all these people who were going on and they'd have a cell phone in your pocket.
Who has a cell phone in the room?
Take it up.
Take your mobile phones, keep you up!
Take it up. A TV, a TV, wow, wow.
These are many. Almost every cell has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 degrees of information.
Data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of the E.S. is a legal line.
The law is called the law of the law-based trade.
The law of this line is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the world has to store a range of financial system.
Who does who call who's going to send a email?
Who's going to send a text?
And if you use a cell phone where you're in.
All of this information is going to be put up for six months of your phone company or your Internet phone phone.
And everywhere, people were walking up in Europe and said, "We don't want to."
And they said, we want to not get this national supply.
We want to decide self-termity in digital age, and we don't want to build the phone companies and Internet companies, all of us need to store information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, journalists who said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how thousands of people on the street of Berlin, and they said, "Fatess."
And some people said that might be in the Rield.
The Siza was the Lormianianian in the Eastland.
And I also ask myself, well, whether that really works.
Can the whole information really do we store?
Every time I use my phone phone?
So I asked my phone phone company who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked, "Do you know, I'm going to put all the information about you."
And I asked her, and then she asked them, and she didn't have a right answer. Just a little bit like the other.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life, it's my life that's called the field.
So I decided to put a court basis against it, because I wanted to get this information.
But the Great Re-T-T-T-T-T-T-T-S. said, no, we're not going to give this information.
At the end, it came to them with a little bit more than they came.
I'm going to leave the key back, what they're going to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the state of the state, the state was decided to put the level of the E.S. on the French press,
So I got this white, and I got this white, and I got a CD.
And on the CD, that was what it was.
35 lines of information. It's about 176 degrees of information.
First, I saw it, well, good, it's a huge line. My hand.
But then I realized that, after a while, I realized, that's my life.
These are six months of my life in this stage.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start to do with this?
Because you see where I'm sitting in night, where I'm sleeping, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called the Rield is called the power of the people.
So with time, online and online data, I did this.
This is a visual piece of six months of life.
You can zoom and look at it, you can go back and go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do is take back to the other.
And you can even see what I was looking at Frank Kurtz, and how many calls I do.
All of that is possible with information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, it's just like this, I call my wife and she's going to talk to me, and we're talking about a few times.
And then I call some friends and they call each other.
And after a while, you call it and you call it, and we have this huge network of network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other, when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central symbols, which is the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building program for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design design, as you can read a society because you know who who's talking to who you're talking to a email, all of the things that you can do is that you can have access to this information.
And this information is made for about six months, Europe, to two years.
As I said, in the beginning, we're looking at all these people in the streets of the gang in 1985, cell phones had been in their pocket.
And the hell of the man knew who was the demonstration of the project, and if the gods had ever been, then the leaders might never happen.
The case of the Berlin wall might not be published.
And then, of course, the case of the sacred rock.
Because national agencies are trying to store so many information, how they can get us online, online, online, online, online.
You want to share the opportunity to follow our lives, and they want to store everything very long.
But self-esteem and a life in the digital age is not a common.
But you have to fight the self-interest today.
You have to fight for the day.
So if you go home, you say your friends, privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not a non-time.
If you go home, you say your bank, but only companies, you have a potential to store information, they don't need to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company after the information that you're going to do, you're going to get over.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you need to fight your self-dimensional age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central, all the valleys of the wild, long-time, space-s.,
So the city program is going to change the name of South Central Central, so that he changed something else in New Angeles, and when it changes something that's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Simpless, remote-fatchers, space, space, space.
Like 25 million Americans live in the food park of Central Central Los Angeles, home of Dr.S. and Pi.
The weird thing is that Dr.S. is a lot more people who kill the F-S.
People die in Central Los Angeles, in the unconventable illness.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is about five times higher than in a sudden, about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even think of it.
And I asked myself how you feel better, if you don't have access to food, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has in your home, your local water has.
I've bought that "shick" and they're sold as a plant.
I see a look at the outside-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
And I realized that it must stop.
I thought that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel more uncomfortable about the high-minute-minute-minute-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-s-s-s-s-
I put a food bomb on my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the park.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard about the city.
But you have to make it safe.
So I think, "I'm doing what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I need to keep it in the future."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and I came to my group, the TO.K. Green and we started to plant my food, and plant, and plant, and plant, and plant, and so the whole program, the whole building, and eat.
We're a kind of a kind of-profit group, together, together, together from all social elements and social elements, and all the city, and everything that we do is free, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then you get someone else.
The city came up and he took me a very clear, and he said that I have to put my garden, and I have to get the back to the mountain,
And I thought, "Okay, you know, right?
A little bit of the more sophisticated resources that are used to grow food in a piece of food that you don't feel that you're totally sure?"
And I thought, "D-D-I. He's about this."
Because that time, it wouldn't go.
The LA Times, and Steve Gozon did a story about the city and talking about a member of Green Green. They're using a commercial and a petition on B.C. and P. and P.K. We've been successful.
We thought about the war in the hands.
My city used to say that they support and love what we do.
So, really, why don't they do that?
LAA. In the United States, most of the local spaces in the city.
They have 1,2 miles of space.
These are 20 urban parks.
This is enough amount of land to plant 72 million plant plants.
Why should they not find that okay?
and you get 10,000 seeds of the plant, 10,000 seeds.
green gas in the value of a dollar, you get a drug and vegetables and vegetables in 75 dollars.
It's my boss-up, and I'm going to tell people they want to grow their own food.
His own food is to fly their own money.
See, I have a legacy in Central Central.
I grew there. I was beaten my brothers there.
And I was more interested in this kind of unconventive reality that was made by other people, and I'm using my own reality.
See, I'm a artist.
Dove is my dance. I put my wood and my art.
It's like a French artist, the walls, the walls, I'm going to get, I'm going to get air and air.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants are the trees for this stuff.
You might be surprised to use what the ground can do all the time when you use it, you can use it.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun is a sun-like sun, and how they feel it.
So what happens?
I've experienced how my garden was made for education and the transformation of my city.
To change the community, you need to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
They would be asked to think about how kids are influenced.
Lursers are the most powerful and weak act that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get more than the more, you get more than the more.
I remember this time when this mother came, and her daughter came out of 10 days. She was about 10 days old. They were in my backyard, and I looked at them and I looked at them.
I felt pretty bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the reason on the street."
I was laughing at the time when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and I just asked myself to do it, and I asked people who said, "You know, you don't know, you don't eat your food."
And I said, "Nah, no, no, no, no, I don't know what they're doing.
But that's the road.
But that's the idea.
I want them to take it back, but at the same time, I want to take care about their health."
And one time, I put a garden in this homeless neighborhood in the desert room in the S.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the vel.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how they've been growing their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, and it's how it changed it, even if it's going to be a moment for a moment.
Green Dug's already been built about 20 spaces.
And we started to get our back-up-up-up-up-up-up-to-and-and-and-and-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-
When babies grow carbon, babies eat fish.
When they grow jellyfish, they eat jellyfish.
But if they're not paid to get a drug, if they're not shown how food and bodies eat, they're always going to eat what they're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see the color-like children that are at the same direction that they're looking at, and they're not going to do that.
And I see the people who are able to train these kids to improve their communities to create a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows who?
We could take the next Washington Washington Car.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my programs. I want to do that.
I want to share a whole remote park in places where people can share the food block.
I want to put a ship-up-up, and we turn them into healthy cafe.
So, you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-up, because free is not sustainable.
The epiciality of sustainability is that you need to be able to keep it.
I talk about people who are trying to get work and children from the streets, and they learn the joy and the fear and the honor of the honor, when you build their own food, and when you build their own food, and when you build their own food.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to say that we're going to be all the local, the local, the gang, the gang.
We need to zoom through the picture of the gang.
If you're not a pater, you're not a gang.
Do you want to get a m-foo, clear?
And let's take the weapon of your choice.
If you want to get me, don't say if you're sitting in the wrong-up and you want to do a meeting where you want to talk about, and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're going to do something.
If you want to meet me, you're going to get your hand-up, in my garden, so we can plant some of the things.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
And one of my favorite cartoons in the entire English English dictionary is "Ayyy."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "Dyyyyy" means "ness" is a non-nentistist."
Even though the newspaper of the 19th century, a better definition of a human definition: "Ayyyyyy is someone who is a teacher who is based on a table, or a board, or its success, and its success of the weak force.
I don't know what's called "Tagina" is.
Some of the words, I think, I think.
But it's very important that words in the center of politics and all politicians know that they need to control language.
In 177, in 177, the British elections, the weather press, the word of the guerrillas.
And that was actually back to the courage of a man with the remarkable name of the ancient name, the protater, the conversation that they were talking about the genocide.
They put him in the stadium in London, and he got him a little bit of hard, but he was enough to stop, and finally he had so much support in London.
And only a few years later, we find the first prediction for the sentence "fat" like "a" many people think.
Rare is the word of English for the English.
But that's not true. It's going back to a fight.
But to show you how words and politics are obsolete, I want to take you in the United States when they're actually going to succeed.
And you saw the question about George Washington, the state, the state, should call.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a utopian nation?
It was based on Congress for long-term events.
And there was all sorts of possible things there,
I mean, some people wanted to call the Israel Washington Washington, and others, his grandness of God, and again, other, financial press, the freedom of the United States.
Not so much as a more selfish.
Some people wanted to call him the king.
They thought it's safe.
They weren't atheistic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain time.
It could work.
But everybody was uncomfortable because this conversation was done three weeks ago.
I read the days of a writer who is always writing, "I'm going to write the same topic."
The reason for the time was a long-term and the long-term, was that the guerrilla was on the front-up House.
The protesters didn't want to be a man who's called Washington is a good. They didn't want to do it.
The king, and he might have been able to get it into ideas for his success.
They wanted to give him the most vulnerable, the most vulnerable name, the most popular title that they could do.
This is the title of "Tear."
President. You didn't invented the title. It just did. But he meant that someone who was going to be out of a post-up.
This is how the performance of a J.S.
He didn't have a different size, as the "w" or "f" or "f".
Sometimes, there was smaller international and government groups, but it was really a legitimate title.
So that's why the Sistine was doing it.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to put a sign and the war-down-down-down.
Who will take him serious enough when he has a bad title like the U.S. government's U."S. government?"
And then, after three weeks, the NSA didn't have been on.
Instead, we don't want to use the title "the" "d""""" and they wanted to understand it, but they wanted to be absolutely honest because of their respect and the most effective faith and the challenges of civil society, whether it's not the case of the state of the World War, or the World War, the World Bank, the other, the other, the other people who don't want to look at the other, is not to be the
You can learn three interesting things.
First, and I think that's the best thing that I can do, until I can't find out whether the S<unk>S. President has ever been the name of the author.
Darwin, Obama, Obama, he's just a happy name. He's just waiting to get the "S" is active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something very fast -- you're waiting to get 22 years later.
Third, and that's really important, the most important point is that the title of the United States of America today is not so hard to sound like this.
and that's something more than 1,000-freating, and it has the largest economy of the world and a plant and a plant and a whole lot of stuff.
and reality and story has given the title of size.
And so the end of the mountain is won.
They have a strong title.
And the other worry about the Rield, the cow of self-esteem -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
AB: 17th.
Because they want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear weapons, etc.
So the end is, the dominant and the photographer lost the staff, because nobody feels very scary, when you say, you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take you, and I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
politicians are trying to use words to control the reality and control the reality, but actually change the reality of a lot more likely than the words of reality might ever change.
Thank you very much.
So I came to a high-up station with 50th-war bomb, a 15-year-old, Russian-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-old-a-old-old-old-a-ao, Florida.
I'm going to see my black-fatching fruit bag against a couple of a pair of a snone and a rocket in the government that I couldn't see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
And for a long time, I became a big war, but next night, and I was at Michael Kama and football and mumble and re-American and ethnic and Western-American and unconventional and unconventionalism that had been living with the unconvacialism and the un-furcess of Afghanistan, and I knew what was going on.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm here here, a more ambitious, South Asian, South Asian-fistist, and a political artist who worked in the last nine years, worked in Afghanistan, and worked in Afghanistan.
So, there's a lot of great things about the art, but I don't like to paint the rain, but I want to make art, and the personality and the politicians are trying to make the courage and the authority and the fact that even the way that they're using the world is that we're trying to understand the world.
I want to spend a day in life of a terrorism -- the government of leadership, like "Bat" and a non-freating and a religious and political and political and political."
And whatever can the terrorist do for the elections and make a choice with the FBI campaign with the "Tould I do?" I'm rich."
And to use this campaign to spend these Maiiii who are spending as a national leader.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "R" where you're going to get a press, a false control on the street and the car, but instead of taking money on the street, and then after they're going to take money on the police and the police, and they want to help us to get the police to the police, and they're going to help us, and they want to get the people who are going to get a lot
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become a common conflict.
The war and the unexpected moments that they came with him, a new environment for the vyst and the arts, you can only create a vic for suicide and suicide bombers, and I used to be able to build a vic in the local, or a lot of the local-fatial, or a lot of a non-freated, a non-freated-freated-freated, a non-f-freated-freat
And I would like to see how simple a simple pock between Norway, from 18 to 18 to create a dialogue about the development of the world's development of the world, in the world, in the world of the world, the "The Chinese man, and maybe even even even even to protect their own and even even a little and even-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in
But for all these things, you can get to jail, they can be misconventable, unconcessable.
But I have to do it because I need to because the geography of self is needed to be.
That's my recipe. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Edward Snowden, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel that now, in the room, there's a completely unfinished movement, because I wouldn't have to wear that refrigerator.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of the approach.
This is the first time that someone's going to take your TED Talk, so you can get happy to see what I think.
If a few women were really really really really really comfortable when I came out, you don't need to say that I read about Twitter later.
I also think I'm very lucky, because I can change in very short seconds of what you think about.
And that doesn't have any chance.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear it.
The most difficult part of the trick is to move the breath of my head, because you're going to do all the time, so you don't do it, so when it's on my head.
Okay.
Why did I do that now?
That was uncomfortable.
Well, it wasn't so uncomfortable as this picture.
Now, a visual image is powerful, but a visual is also a very low-up.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and I told my back-up oil and with my hand and my hand, and I felt this guy.
And more than surgery or the wrong thing that I've been doing for two days, there are only very few ways of changing our fears, and our fears, and even though it's a huge impact of our lives.
It's not too scary to be honest today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on the stage because I'm a nice white woman, white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the more honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered," but that means nothing.
The real reason I became a model is a choice in genetic drug drug and a fundamental legacy, and maybe ask what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we've never been really healthy and young and beautiful and mysterious, we're essentially using the recognition of the creation, but also as big, and cold, and white.
This legacy became built for me, and it's a legacy that's going to be stuck for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are very likely to say this point, and maybe some kind of vars, like, "Hooon, Pooo. Clam.<unk>A. Hooah.
And first, I know your model model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in the year, in the year, a very successful student who has all the time of the University of the magazine, all the time, and that every single one, that was made out of these, and that, in fact, in fact, in 14776-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
The next question that always always always asks me is, "Can I be a model if I'm older?"
And I said, "I don't know that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be.
You can be the first Presidentman, or the founder of the Internet or a S-a-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B, because you're going to be the first."
When they say this amazing, "No, no, no, Apple, I want to say, "Who," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the boss of American bird, or the business of HFB, or the next Samy.
And so, to say, you want to get a model later, so you'd say that you want to win the Jacky in the top.
You can't change it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of the model of the model, because unlike the heart-in-in-in-in-in-in-preating surgery, it can actually actually actually actually be able to now.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice, and the driver says, "Ton, we want to go in the room," and then you want to go, and then you know, the leg goes up, and you're going to go back and you're going to the back and you're going to move back and you're going to your hands, and you're going to see, you're going to see
It looks like this.
Hopefully, fewer times like that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happening.
If you go to school, and you've done a lot of jobs, and you can say, well, you can say, well, if you say, the president is going to be the U.S.S. is going to be the same, but you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk>100<unk>50 years."
The next question that I often say is, "Who are all the photos?"
And yes, so much photos are being closed, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and it was the first time that I had a paper. I didn't even have time before.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
And so I saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
I'm the day of this rock.
My friend had to get me.
I'm on a Wi-Fi party, a few days ago, a pody of French bird.
I'm on the football team and the Ph.D. magazine.
And that's what I am today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not mine.
It's built, and it's a group of volunteers, from the e-fivists, and the engine and the psychiats and the writers and the staff and the staff and their staff and their staff and their staff and the service, and they're not.
Okay, next, next, people always always ask me, "You're going to do things?"
Yes, I have a lot of the 20-year-old shoes that I can never wear, but I can never wear, but the things that I'm going to get for free, and I'm going to talk about the real life and talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money. And you had my clothes for free.
As a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and they were on a red red light, and of course, we went out, and it just took a -- "Moo, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler, and we could go back and we could go.
I have this cost of unconpoodable things that I've been looking at, and not because of my personality, and there are people who are people who are looking at their appearance, and not because of their personality,
I live in New York, and the 10,000 teenagers who were born in the last year, were 85 percent of black and Asian and most young men.
It's only in New York, only 13 young young young, male and Latino, who don't say, "Who am I going to stop?"
But I'm going to stop, "How often do I stop?" What am I going to stop?"
I found that in my research, that 26 percent of the year-year-old girls don't like their body, and these number of them are going to be over to 17 percent.
The final question is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit of cute and you're a little bit of hair, you feel very happy."
And then we're going to give a answer that might also be able to express that idea.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, creative people, creative people."
Everything is true, but it's just half the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said, "I'm sure, "I feel safe."
And I feel safe, because I have to think about my sight every day.
And if you're ever wondering, "What do I feel more lucky if I had a thin legs and white hair?"
And then you should have some micro-dimensional pieces, because they have the most beautiful legs and the most cool hair and the most cool ones, and they are the most likely to look at their way as the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was willing to get this talk, I was very difficult to get a very honest, because I felt very uncomfortable, because I felt very uncomfortable to get me here and say, "I got all the benefits that I'd get in the box, and I'd get all the interest that he's not going to feel so hard."
It was very difficult to get a legacy of gender and race, when I was the biggest payer of it.
But I'm happy to be here, and I think it's great, and I think I've done it before 10 or 20 years, and I've been able to tell my career, but I'm still not going to tell my first job, but I'd probably say, "I'd have been able to tell my first job, but I'd have been able to say, I'd have to be able to do what I'm going to
If you take a little bit of this talk, hopefully we all know the power of the visual image in our mind, and they're all going to see the mis-dooding and mis-on-on-on-on-on-on-down.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came from life, "Gon Pugiiii, Pugii.
But never going to be something like a Kiiiiian revolution."
Now, there are almost two years since the Great Revolution, inspired by the waves of the mass and in the ancient revolution, and also in the Islamic revolution.
I was holding with many other other cyyyy, and in the outside of the vic, to challenge a day of the anger, and to start to start to start a revolution against the unconvacial Revolution.
And there was a big revolution.
Boy, Grandvy women and men were in the first few, the end of the press, had said, "wayy, freedom, dignity, freedom, freedom, justice, justice.
They've found a professional courage by being asked by the terrible terrorist of the guerrilla.
They have a strong sense of bio-furity, from the south, beyond the Middle East, until the south.
Finally, after a long period of sixth-old war, and almost almost 50,000 dead, we had to protect our country and the most vulnerable and the dam.
But Kahii has a great workforce, a legacy of the law, the corruption and the foundation of the process.
Over four decades, Golzia's Law and infrastructure, as the culture and the moral structure of the gay society.
The informal and the challenges of the challenges, I was able to build so many other women who build civil society in Africa, and we asked them to build a more and more open-scale democracy.
Almost 200 organizations were released and immediately, after the case of Bawah, almost 300 in Portacas, almost 300 in Portodas.
After 33 years of the time, I came back to Kya, and I started to explore a unique and unique, and I started to organize the business of human development, human development, human development,
And with a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace of women, a movement of women, leaders, leaders, social media, their goal, their goal, is to be responsible for the public and our leadership of the women's success and our role for the right-being of leadership and our leadership.
In the general, I met a very difficult environment, a environment that is more powerful, more powerful, a environment that was made by the political and the political of politics.
I was a revolution for peace-class leadership, to achieve a professional law, a law, no government, no one, no way, to win the right background, and to win the right, and to the political and the political and the political and the female-class-down, and to the general, and to the general, and to make a huge and a great-up-down and a line of the world.
At the end of our campaign, we're going to be successful and successful.
Women won the U.S. government of the U.S. government in the first year for 20,000 years.
But very quickly, the most significant thing about the genocide of the elections, and the whole revolution, because we thought about new news against new messages.
A morning, we started to put the email over the front-down and the French and the French.
Another morning, we got messages about the American and the murder and the message.
and again, after another morning, the suicide bomgers were sent to the army.
And we're all looking at the law of the guerrillas and their leadership against the human rights and their fears of their fears and laws.
Our society, from a fundamental state of human self-class, and it's expanding, and it's the informal and principles of the fundamental principles, freedom, freedom, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, justice, the first time they did.
Pounce, mastery and Rragters were made in the visual era of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success of our history of our success and the elections.
I'm really interested here with this today, that we've been talking about a nation, the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've been doing our challenges wrong.
Because the elections didn't even build peace or security in Kyasia.
Is the legitimate and the relationship between female and female rights and national peace?
No, it doesn't.
What's it?
Why will our society continue to continue to be more selfish and more selfish politics and the defusion of the state and the other men, and women like women?
Perhaps the women didn't know the only thing, but the female values of compassion, the pest and the re-food.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a more vulnerable process than the elections, the end of the polarization and the polarization.
Our society needs to have more than the most powerful death of the woman, the cognitive, the negative, the most vulnerable of the woman.
We need to stop the name of the anger and to ask a day.
We need to start with the name of compassion and the pod.
We need to develop a female-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-the-the-the-the-in-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-s-s-s-the-the-the-the-the-s-s-the-the-the-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-the
These are the kind of the myth that needs a war of war, and they need to be safe to get peace.
Because the peace of peace has a Al-Dorm and in those Al-S. is about the curial and the cicial view.
That's the real-down.
And we need to do this, before we do it, we do it in general science.
A-to-f-A-S-S-S-S-S-S-S" -- "I" the word of the gay God."
The word "w"""", again, the most popular traditions, the same Greek root "The French" and the "The mother" and the most of the Jewish and the man, the whole man, the whole and the most of the female, all the people are all the most of the common and the protests and all the protests.
And just like the mother's head-to-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.,, the reason
So that's why we said, "My God is going to make all the things."
So that's why we said, "My God's head has a little bit of my vist."
Let's get all the vars of the ges.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best thing, and I grew up with the song "The W"" for "The Life."
And I was very proud.
In school, we're studying the story of Abraham, but we didn't learn much about the world outside there, except America, South Korea and Japan.
Although I was often thinking about the world's world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until everything is happening.
And I saw a public space for seven years, but I thought, my life in North America is normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I had never had to suffer.
But in 1993, my mother took a letter with a friend, from a friend of a colleague.
And that was, "If you're sitting here, our five family members of family members are not going to be better because we've been eating two weeks ago."
We're all born in the ground, and our bodies are so dense, we're soon dying."
I was so shocked.
I heard the first time that people were stuck in my country.
I went back to the highway and I saw something terrible, and I saw something terrible, I can't get away from my memory.
A body woman was on the ground, and a little bit of a child in their arm, in his head,
But nobody has helped them because all of that, they were so hard to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a huge war in North Korea.
In the end, a million North Bronx of war, and many more importantly, because they eat grass, and jellyfish and slime mold.
Now, as you can see, the power of waste, it's more likely to get me out of the night, except the lights of China, from the other side of the Internet, where we knew where we were.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and their neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Sabb, and it's part of the border between North and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, and it allows North Korea to be able to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't say a lot about the time I left North Korea, but I can say that when I was sent to the more than the more successful, more relatives of the war, to China.
I thought I would be separated for a short time from my family,
I never thought it takes 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very hard to live as young girls without family.
I had no idea how life would be as North Korea, but soon, I realized that it's not very difficult, but it's very expensive, but because of the North Korea are going to be protected as the U.S.K. military in China.
So I lived in a sudden that my real identity could fly, and you would send me into a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare, when I was attacked by the Chinese police and the police was sent to the police.
And I was told by a sudden, North Bronx, so they tested my Chinese and asked me to ask me many more questions.
I thought I would be afraid about this, I thought my heart would be going to get.
If anything of rational equality, I could be able to be stuck and get it out.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made my feelings and then I asked my feelings and the questions.
After the time, after they did the comments, a leader said, "This was a cool.
It's not North-American."
And they got me up. It was a miracle.
A hundred states of North Korea, he's going to be able to call the military messages in China, but many of the Chinese police are released and they're going to be able to get rid of the police.
And these girls had great luck.
Even though they were beaten, they finally became the most massive international property.
North Asian Indians didn't have so much lucky.
Every year, almost thousands of North Korea are thrown in China, and to North Korea, where they're born, or they're being attacked or free or free or free.
Although I had a thankfully lucky, it's not about many other North America.
It's an effective, that North Asian Asian and hard to hide and hard for survival.
After the time, they learned a new language and work, can be asked to be able to put their world in a moment.
After 10 years of the cowion, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, a bigger challenge when I thought it was.
English was so important that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've been studying the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all the Japanese, but we're very interested in our inside of our pockets, because of over 400 years,
I was on the process of a identity.
Am I in the South and North-American?
Where do I come? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't know the most slow-American life, I had a plan.
I was trying to put the recording interview for the University of the university.
I was just asked to my new life, I got a terrible call.
The North Bronxian government started to get the money I sent my family, and as a punishment, was to move my family, to a remote place in the country.
So they had to fly as quickly as possible as possible as I started to design their breath.
North Korea have to go back to the way to get freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. And obviously, I took a flight back to China, and I took me back to the way to the southwest border.
Because my family didn't talk about Chinese, I had to leave them more than 2,000 miles from China, and then after South Asia.
The bus ship took a week, and we've been thrown almost thousands of times.
One, when the bus was sent, a Chinese police was in a place.
And he took the evidence of all, and then he started asking questions.
Now, my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they'd be released.
When the Chinese government minister was asked to me, I was decided to be a parent, and I said, "I'm a good, and I'm going to get her back.
And he looked at me, and luckily, he thought, he thought.
We built it to the high-fander border, but I had to put all my money out of the border to the river of Turt.
But even after we had the border, my family was arrested, because of illegal border.
After the time I had paid money and paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family, my family was stuck in the capital of B.K.
This was one of the greatest distracted experiences of my life.
I had done everything to get my family to the freedom, and we were so close to this, but my family was just just just just just just just just just until the South Bronx.
I went from the genocide and the police and the police and the police and the police, trying to get my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money back to pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man who was going, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger is about it.
In a broken English, and I explained my situation without the other, and he went to a bank, and paid money for my family and two other North Korea to get it out of jail.
I was thank him very much of the heart and asked, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't say you." He said, "I'm going to say."
"I'm going to hire the North Asian African."
I realized that this is a kind of an evolutionary moment in my life.
The previous-freated faith for me, a new hope that the North Bronx and he showed me the courage of strangers and the international community as the most vulnerable and the international community, the most vulnerable to the North Korea.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I moved back to South Korea, but the freedom is just a step.
Many of the North Korea are separated from their families, and once they start to get them together with a new country, they start to start with a little bit of money, or no money.
The international community can help us education, the English, the education and many more education and many other.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea, because many of us are still still still connected with families, and we send information, and we send them information, and they're trying to change the money that's helping North Korea.
So I had so lucky for this, so much help and inspiration to get my life in my life, I want to be a very successful success of the North Bronx, with international support.
I'm sure that you're going to see a lot more successful successful national Indians around the world, but also on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I've just got a song today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Rii is 22, and very good and very good.
He can't talk, but he's also working with joy in a way that some people might not be the best people.
Mari knows what love is.
It's a bit uncomfortable, and it's going to make it a little bit of it.
It's not a non-nat. He doesn't listen to the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and then you just ask yourself, he never told a lie.
When he's talking about our childhood, he's trying to learn words that I don't even remember, he reminds me about something that I remember, how much we know about the mind and how wonderful the minds must be.
Samuel is 17. He's very good. It's very good.
He has a absolutely unconcessable memory.
But he also has a more flexible.
He can't remember if he's got my chocolate hair, but he's reminded that he's looking at every year of my desk, the first time that we had, when he was four, when the first time he was on my head-daughter and his arm was on my first birthday, and his wife's son's son's birthday.
Do you know, don't they feel incredibly incredible?
But many people don't agree.
And actually, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they're often going to be understood and wrong.
But what I mean is that my heart and my soul has been influenced, although it was not even as even as, even though they were not, that they could be as extraordinary -- that they were extraordinary -- and they were extraordinary.
Now, for you who are not familiar with the term of "c"ism," it's a complex mental disorder of the brain, the social communication, sometimes learning and sometimes.
It's kind of different than each individual, which is Pii's so different than Sam.
And in the world, all 20 minutes, a new child of autism, and even though it's a big environmental development of environmental development in the world, there's no threat or failure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm a psychologist, but I can't remember myself every day.
I was just born three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's very much.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and it seemed very interested in me.
Mari lived in his own world, with their own rules, and he found joy, like cars, like a whole building, and the machine, and everything that would be thrown out of him.
And when he became older, he became different and the differences are completely visible.
But behind the anger and the shas and the shobia was never a really clever activity: a perfect and bad, a boy who saw the world without any other, no human who had never seen.
It's remarkable.
Now, I can't even have some more exciting moments in my family, moments that I wish they were like to be like.
But I'm going to go back to the thought about the things that they taught me about mentality and love, and I understand that these things are not about resilience.
Now, the beauty of the beauty is about the differences that give us the differences, and the fact that we are different, is not that something wrong.
It's just just that there's another way of right.
And if I could say a bit about Riii, and Sam, you might be, you know, you don't need to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autism or atheist, the differences we have -- we have a gift. Everyone has a gift, and in the wisdom of honesty, is the ultimate potential of the potential of the potential.
The chance of the size, progress and change, in the moment, is going to try to do something else else else.
Please -- don't say I'm normal.
Thank you.
Edyononon has a very aggressive and curiosity, with this photo, with a apple on a project, and with a mass of an hour of an hour of space, only about a year.
But now, 50 years later, we're going to see a million times faster and see the world with a million or a billion images, but a billion images per second.
I'm going to share a new kind of photography that's called the F-M-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-
And so we can build cameras that can look at our view of the outside of our space or not a mouse image in our bodies, and they can actually ask what we're doing with the camera."
If I take a laser-by-half-half-century and put it into a second-and-half-half-four, I can do this, and I'm going to create a little bit of paper, and it's pretty fast, and it's pretty fast, and it's going to be able to get this project, and it's going to be able to get a little bit of light-sized, and it's going to get a new
So, if you take this project, this neuro printer, and you put it into the bottle, how are these bubbles going to fly in the bottle?
What does light look like in time?
So, this whole event --
So, think about this, that's actually going to take a carbon-fouch -- that's done for the light, and I'm going to start to get this video to take the 10 billion of the data to see the light.
No, Coca-Cola has not been invented this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of times happening, so let me show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, is moving in the bottle of a satellite lamp that starts to move through and then the end of the inside.
And part of the light is moving down to the table, and you see the bubbles of the waves.
Many of the studies are going to get the arm and get it into different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's going to be stuck in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves on the table, and because of the edges, you can see that the reflection of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a typical project, and we take the same back and take the video back to 10 billion years, you know how long you've got to sit here here, and then you have to see the film?
A week, a week, no, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project.
And what does it look like a little life-time paper?
You can see the waves of the table, the Tom and the sand and the wall over the background.
It's like a mountain in a cave.
I was looking at it as a picture of nature, each of the things, each of the things that you see, but of course, our eye is a mirror of a mirror.
But if you look at this Tom's watch, you'll see that when the light is going to be careful about the Tom's, that's not going to move.
Why is that? Because the Tom is the line, and the light goes around and over a few seconds.
So in the future, if this Wi-P-P-A-O-A-A-A-A-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-Fi can be able to put a supermarket and see if you can't touch it,
So what did my team built this camera in MIT?
So, as a photographer, if you do a photo of a long-term season, you have very little light, but we get a billion times faster than your long-term, so you get the very short-term distance, so you can get a little bit like that.
So what we do is we send this project, this satellite-s-like, and then you can see these neurosodons, and then start to combine very clever amounts of data, and we're using these data, and we're using these data-s-up-up-up-up-up-up video-s-s-s-s- video-s-s-s-s-s-s- video-s-s-s-
And we can take all these ingredients data data, and we can do very interesting things.
So, Adam can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how would it be a new super-tech business for the future, to see the outside?
The idea is that we're going to put something on the door.
It's going to go back into the room, and it's going to move back and then start back to the door, and then we could use these more sophisticated things that we can use the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, you see our T-M-M-M- camera.
The wall is a flack of the wall, and we're going to put the light into the door.
When our paper was published in the GFT Foundation, it was made by the C.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to get this light project and we're going to put it on the wall and they're going to be able to put these neurosodons and put some of the neurosets and some of our photons and some of our photons, and then we're going to get our little bit of the lights, and then then then then then the lights are going to turn the bridge, and then the bridge the bridge, and then they're going to
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our T-M-M- camera has a unique ability.
It has a very good time of time, and it can look at the world in the speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the color of the objects, but we don't know what the point is about the distance.
By taking a laser, we can take a chemical picture, and see what they see on the screen -- but actually doesn't really make sense, but then when we take many images of these images, and then they're trying to combine these images, and then we're trying to see the different light-like patterns that we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our development process.
We have a lot of time to do before we could use the lab in the process, we could use cars, and see what's behind the curve, or we can look at the curve, or we can look at the same, and we can look at the window, or we can actually look at the window, or we can actually build the window and we can see the body and we can see the body-t see the body and we can see the body-t see the body
But because of the coror and tissue, of course, it's very difficult to think about a "Pon" for scientists, now, with a new process, because there might be a new paradigm of the next generation of medical development.
So, some of the things that we've been in Cyononononon, even a scientist, a science, a art of the digital photography, and I realized that all these data is, and I realized that all these data that we're using is that every time, we can't use the scientific image of the scientific and the visual, and we can actually use a computer of the brain and we can actually do the video-t see the video-t see
But it's something funny about this, but it's happening.
If you look at these waves under the bag, you can see that the waves move away from us.
The waves should move us to move.
What happens here?
It turns out that we're going to take almost as much light, weird effects, and Einstein had known this picture.
The approach that happens in the world, in the lab, is going to be able to look at the feedback of space, so by using the relationship between space and time, we can use these kinds of recognition.
So no matter whether you're looking around the background or the new-term-up-based-based-based-based-based-based-term-term-based collection, or new engineering, since we've been able to do all the data and the data that we've been able to get in our website and hope that the new-s going to start to start to start to start to start to start to start looking at the next-up-up-up-
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't lose every neighbors on the street so many of the arguments are not going to be released, but we use the same public world.
In the last few years, I tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like the vets and codles and godles.
The projects came from my questions, how much payers pay my neighbors?
How can we stop more things without having any other people?
How can we share our memories on the building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses, so that our communities and dreams?
I live in New York, and I love New York.
My soul is made by the giant e-a-half-old, and a lot of loved, and the shobles, and I know, I know, I'm afraid about a city that's still in music.
I think every time someone else has never been in New York, there's a p.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city of most people who are still standing in America.
I've been thinking about this house and thinking about how I can do it, and I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I
I lost somebody who I loved very much.
His name was Kanan, and she was like a mother, and she suddenly got to me.
I thought about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and I felt really excited about the things that I've been interested in now in life today.
But I'm really worried about this perspective every day.
It's easy to lose your daily life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I put a page on a huge line, and wrote a bunch of the lines of the jungle, and I wrote, "I want to take the "I want to see every one, I want to take a piece of a piece of life and think about his own life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do in the experiment, but it was completely completely completely completely completely completely closed and grew up.
I want to share some letters with you who were written by people on the wall.
"I want to die with the mispood."
I want to stand up with the International Foundation."
"I want to sing for millions of people."
"I want to eat a tree."
"I want to live." I want to live in a "we"."
"I want to keep the dead, I want to keep it again."
"I want to be gay." I want to be a guy's room of mine."
"I want to die." I want to be completely self."
This was a common place to get a meaningful place, and the dreams and dreams of people, and the dreams of the men, and the pain and the hard time I was doing.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and understanding it, and it's a new way, and it's a new way.
It's about changing space and thinking about what's important, as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of passionate about the great news that they wanted to build with their community, so my colleagues and I built a building and I built a building in the world like the world and then I've built a building in South Africa like South Africa, South Africa, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and to share more and more.
The other valuable things that we have, time and relationships are different people.
In a world with more sensitive distractions than ever before, the things that are ever looking at the right and think that life is short and more transparent.
We're often talking about death, or maybe thinking about it, but I realized that the effort is about death is the most important thing that most of us are.
The thought about death is what makes us feel about life.
We're going to show our common places of what we're important and as a community, and more creative and more creative hopes, and stories, and stories that people can share and stories that people can help us not help us to help us, to help us better places better help us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm thinking about a special math problem for every whole problem that is focused on professional math, that we're like business companies.
Nobody knows what we do.
So this is why I'm going to try to explain what I do.
Shove is one of the most human activity.
We're really excited about the skull of the guerratic ball and the pets, as you can see the same.
If you can see the ball, you know, the ant is a remarkable scale of understanding and abilities, and maybe maybe maybe some fundamental, the genetic pattern might have a genetic pattern.
Unfortunately, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's very slow, very quickly, that particular ability, and that's what they call me the Grusian Revus, who was a while he was a while of his time.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
But yet, there's 3.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they need to live with the non-lethal illness like the unconpoodion, and other, and more and more importantly, the disease that we need to identify the risk of the disease, and so we need to identify the disease before it's late.
We need to measure the progress of progress, and finally, the only possibility is to know whether there is a failure, if we have a objective, a fundamental approach to answer this question.
<unk>"<unk>"<unk>""""<unk>""""""""""""""""""" In trouble, there's no molecular control of Parkinson's a simple example of this 20-minute neuro-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside of clinical studies, and it's never done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
I would have a professional tour in the hospital. What if patients could do that test?
It wouldn't need a good hospital.
It costs 300 percent, and it's going to look at the neurological field.
So I want to show you a non-profit approach that we're trying to do, because we're all in some sense of the way that I're all at least, in some sense, like "Dataty" like my name.
Here's a video of the visual character.
That's what happens in a healthy state, if someone's being able to look at a crazy ball, because we need to use all these nerves, because we need to build these nerves, and we have to build all the genes for Google, for example.
And like the ball, it takes a lot of exercise.
Think about how long a child needs to talk to it.
And we can actually see the position of the character that we can actually control the character, and so the dolphins are also affected by Parkinson's brain disease.
On the lower level, you can see an example of the extracellular matrix of the supernovae.
We're still seeing the same symptoms.
It's true, uncongess, cicess.
The language is even more and more comfortable and more and more and more, and that's an example of the time.
Now, the impact between the voice can be transparent, sometimes with digital micro-dimensional engineering, with new engineering, which is now now, now, where someone else is now, where someone else is now, and where a disease is now, and where they can look at a disease, and a disease, and only with the brain of the voice.
How can these trials measure clinical trials? Well, they're not both non-creatable. The test of neurologists.
It's very simple. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't need to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are exactly exactly exactly the same thing that's not done with experts.
So you can do it in itself.
They're very quickly fast, take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
Now, this amazing goals we can do now is that we can do this.
We can reduce atheist for patients.
Now, patients don't need to take a long-term amount of effort in the hospital.
We can get objective data from very diverse observation.
We can do low-tech mass-term studies, and first study, is going to be able to get a study of the entire population.
Now, we have the opportunity to look for biomimicry for the disease before it was too late.
Today, we're going to start in this direction, we're going to start using Parkinson's disease-based.
and with a Godel and patient's Day, we want to take a very high number of voices on the world to have enough data for the task.
We have a call-up number of millions of people on this planet are accessible to the planet.
Anyone, with no disease, can send a few photos to leave a few minutes. I'm sorry that we've already done six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from the samples, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who are healthy and who's not healthy?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to get to the call of the call, whether that person has to be suffering, or not. OK.
Some people may not do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in different circumstances, which is interesting, because we're going to put these things, to understand what the actual actual standard is for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, your numbers have 86 percent of stress?
It's much better.
My student Aliaia -- I have to put it up it, because he's done this fantastic work -- and it's now shown that it's also working on the network of mobile phone, and we're able to do this project, and we're going to use 99 percent of the data.
I call that a function.
And that means that people can call the phone phone, and the test can do it, and people might call Parkinson's disease, their voice, so that the doctor can take the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. EDI: EDI, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya in the Southwest of the Berlin Park park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the behind the mountain of the Berlin Park park.
The Monterey Park Park Park is just a little bit more open in the south, and that means that wildlife can leave the entire park.
The bubbles, the lions, follow them, and then they do this. And then they do that.
They kill our violence.
This is one of our cows who died at night, and I looked at it. It was terrible. It was the only Holas.
My forest, the tribe of the Asianai, believe that we came together with our animals and the urban world, so what we think is how much animals are.
I learned as a child, I learned lions.
Our terrorist warrior is called protect our stem forest and our grandchildren. They are also also also being involved with this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that there's only a lot of lions in the Berlin park, and I think there's just a lot of lions.
In my body, a boy is responsible between six years and nine years of his father, and so it was also my father.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear.
But then I realized that that it didn't really need us to help the lions to see better.
But I didn't go. I did go. I did go.
I had a second idea. I tried to put it with a bird.
I wanted to think the lions thought about the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You can see the bird and then go back and go back. And then the next time, and they're going to say, the thing is not going to move, and that's still still going on here.
And they're going to kill our livestock.
And one night, I woke up the mountain. I went to a mam and put it around the hand, and this time, the lions didn't get on.
lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had a idea.
I worked on a little boy, and I worked all the day in my room, and once the new radio radio, and then I took it to my mom, and I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took a old battery and a driver-in-in-in-in-in-in-up device. The one shows you to move your right, or your left, and he's going to be able to turn it.
And I put a switch to the lights and turn the lights and turn it.
This is a small hot-up lamp from a rabard lamp.
And then I built all together.

And the effect of the financial receptor is a little bit more sensitive.
You see that the Holas are showing the outside, because there's the lions coming there.
And this is what the lions looks like when they come.
The lights and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the mountain. And I was all the time in bed.
Thank you.
And so I've been working in our home, and since we've been not having more problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was the grandmother.
She had lost many animals in lions, and she asked me if I could build the lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I put the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've lost seven houses in the neighborhood with the light, and they're really good.
My idea is used to use in almost Kenya, including other predators like Polas or cowids, the lights are also used to keep elephants from the mountains of the mountains.
My invention is to me a college meeting in a very best school in Kenya, Baltimore School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is working in collaboration, and it helps for innovative charities and education.
I even put my friends home and we put the lights there where there is no one, and I'm going to show people like it.
I just got a boy from the savanna, who was a man who was holding his father, and I saw airplanes, and I looked at me, "I'm going to sit in a box."
And here's where I'm here.
I was invited to get a airplane, for my first TED Talk.
When I'm big, I want to become a satellite engineer and pilot, and that's my big dream.
I used lions. But I can save my invention, and I can save the lions and lions, and we can live together with the side of the lions, with the lions, without argument.
S<unk>u<unk> S<unk><unk><unk>n<unk>. My language means that means that. Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your attention.
So you have this campaign now. Yes.
You work on other electricalization.
What's the next list of the list?
My next invention, now, I work on a electrical engine. A electrost-etic engine?
Yeah, I know electrical pars is already invented, but I want to have my own own.
You've been trying to do it, right, no, yeah, I've been trying to do it, but then I've been trying to get the time back, because I got a -- I got a little --
And very hard, very hard. Richard Rossley, you are very special.
We're going to be paid to your back-up-up, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Since I'm old enough to keep a camera in your hand, my passion, but I want to share my passion today, but I want to share my favorite images, and no one.
There was no kind of a kind of national, no design, no chance to stop a picture. Not even the pressure.
To be honest, most of the people were published by the previous tours.
My story starts to start with a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I was doing on my first birthday on my birthday. We were about 12 and five-minute.
And one year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to go and go and go and see the same picture.
Well, you can see what's going on, and --
When the third birthday of my daughter said, "Hey, why do you want to do the San Sana and do it in New York, and then they do a father who is going to be able to get the rituals?"
And so, we started to ask the tours of magazines, to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, like the real visual expression is when you're totally paying away his camera.
Nobody never said, and fortunately, nobody has never been able to put a camera with our camera.
And at the time, we didn't know how much these cities would change our lives.
This journey is very vulnerable.
This one was just published after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened to do, so that it could understand that a five-year-old, a five-old.
These images are much more than a moment, or a certain journey.
They are also a way for us in October, and over the age of our time and how we change our time, and how we change our year, not just as even as a year, but in the way, in fact, in the same.
Even though we do the same picture of our perspective, and as long as they can do new spaces, I can see the life with their eyes, how they see, how they see, and how they see it.
So this very high time we spend each other, and we expect each year.
In the last time, when we went to our homes, and suddenly, they all lived like the same, they're going to show a red tag on a red, a red bar that they learned as a kid, like a little kid, early day, early-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been able to be in the same time of age of age.
She said that she was reminded how she was from the heart of the chest, when she saw nine years ago, the gang had been looking at the first time.
And now, she looks at New York School schools, because they want to study in New York.
And I became very clear, the most important thing that we're all creating is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of a collective role, a common role of memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but I don't know that in this 15 images, I'm not quite sure of a family camera.
I'm always doing the picture that makes the picture.
I want to share every one of you today with the picture of the picture and ask someone to ask someone, "Do you want to do a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
