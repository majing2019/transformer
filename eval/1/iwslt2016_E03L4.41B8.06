When I was old, I was born on a morning of the pelish of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound.
My father was sitting up on his little little little little, tiny radio, the news of the conference.
He looked at what was pretty amazing, which was pretty amazing, because he was talking about the news news news.
He called "The World Bank," "The World's largest."
I didn't know what was, but it was really surprised, but he was really very happy.
"You can go to a good school," he said, "I'm going to go."
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The British war is the power of Afghanistan, when I was six, and he was married for girls,
So I was able to get five years old than my mother and my mother and my mother, who didn't have to be able to be able to be a school school.
So, we could go home to school.
Every day, we took another way to do anything that could be done, where we went.
We've got our books in the books, so it's like this, as we could go back.
We've been able to be in a house, about 10 girls in a small room in a small room.
In the winter, it was pretty cool, but it was pretty cold.
We all knew that we were going to live our life, teachers and our parents.
And again, the audience had to be sitting on a week, because the Wright had been left.
We were never sure how much they knew about them.
Are they aware of us?
Do they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go home.
I had been very lucky in a family, especially as a family, as a lot of the women and the students and the stories were made.
My father was completely interested on his time.
A man from a high-American war. He was the one of his mother, his mother, and his mother, who was invited to send home to school and his father's father's father's father.
My mother was born, but his friend was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she was in the way to go home to school for a school, and women and women and women and women from the streets.
And my father -- this was the first one in his family, who had never been a family.
And it's really clear that his children would be able to give their kids to a career, but his colleagues, despite the war, despite the war, the war.
It looked at a much more effective risk of their children to send their kids to school.
I know that I was in the last years of the British War, sometimes sometimes the worst of our life, and the fear of our life, the fear of the fear and the fear of the fear.
I was so good enough, but my father said, "I'm going to thank you, you can go in your life. You can all be in your life.
Your money can be used. You can get the war on your house.
But one thing is, what's going on here, and when you're here, and when we're going to get to your food, and when we're going to get to your blood phone for your lunch, we've got to get to the car.
So, you want to be willing to get you back?"
Today, I'm seven years old.
I was in a country that has been used by the age of the war.
More than the women in my career have been a higher career than the university, and when my family was so much so much so that my family was not so much so much for my family, I was able to be able to be able to be a lot of women.
I'm going to be here, as a teenager, as a very-time-time-time-time-American university.
When I went back to London, my father who was born from his family, because he was a man who was his friend, who he was his friend, who he was the first one of his friend, who was the first one of my father,
It's not just just just a designer for my college, but it's the first woman who I was the first woman who was the first woman who was in the house with the car, and I was a car with the car.
My family seems to me.
I have great dreams, but my family has always been different for me.
So I'm a global for 10 percent of the public campaign for the public education of women.
So I've been able to use the first, and maybe the first student for the school, in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, in the school, for the school, for the school, for the school, for the school, is still enough.
It's amazing to see how the students of my school with a great deal with her school, and they've been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of them.
And to see how their parents and their parents and their parents, as they were in the time, as my parents and my parents, and all of the time,
So, like Roberti, that's not the name, and I can't show the face of my father, but the father's son, but his father's father's father's father's father.
A month, and he was his daughter's son on the house of the city of San Francisco, and she was the woman's family, and she's a bus from the city of the street, and she's a few minutes.
When he went home, he's going to the phone, and he's going to give a voice, and he's going to him when he was going to go home, and he would try to try to try to go home to school.
He said, "I'm going to tell you if you want to go, but I'm not going to leave the future of my daughter's voice because of your friend's voice, because of your favorite music, because of your favorite and the other musical experiences."
So the war, so I've been able to find something that's going on the West, the West of the West, and the most of us, is the success of us, the father, who is the gift of his son, and his son is the only important to be the father.
That's not going to be the fact that our kids are not really interested in our success.
And it's often often that the ones that are going to be reuse and more honest for the future of their own group, but of their own students, but of a society, as a society in India, as the men who's not so much as the men who's afraid of men.
The U.S., only one million girls in school -- because it was almost illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls in Afghanistan.
In America, from America, from America, is going to look like this.
The Americans can see how much of these changes are.
I'm sure that the changes are not from the world and they're all over the U.S.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents, who they are able to do with their parents, and they see them, I'm a very lucky way to share the future and a very personal change.
In Ghana, for me, the hope of the hope and the hope, and remember me, and I remember the girl who's going to go back to the day, the girl's Day.
It's how they have great dreams.
Thank you very much.
All of the things I do is I've been working with my life -- I've been born by seven of the years in Africa, about young women.
In 1978, I see seven of them -- but I'm seven of them, but I'm in South Korea, California, California, California, California, California, the Southwest, the Southwest, and the Southwest, and the Southwest, and the media has been working with the social media.
I've been working with a old-to-LOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, and every single project we had been able to have the legs,
I was really afraid.
I thought, 20 years ago, we're good people and good work in Africa.
Instead of all, we've lost, which we've been looking at.
The first project, which I was the book of "Jeopardy," the Surty", a journalist, was a journalist, a journalist, which was a journalist, we wanted to show people like the Sanian, like the S.
We came out with the Great Park in Southwest, and in the middle of the Sijuana, which is what we call the Surtiian and the local workers of the local workers and the civilians and the guerrillas and the guerrilla and the guerrilla and the guerrilla and the guerrilla.
Of course, the whole thing that we had was not really interested with, so we were working with the work, and sometimes they also felt in the work.
We were curious that there was no kind of a lot of waste of California.
But instead of asking questions why they don't use them, and we said, "Oh, we're really sure we're here."
"Tight" is still time to save people to save the people of the Sanania."
Of course, all of us, all of Africa.
We had this amazing bread-American depression in Italy, and they were so much big, in S.K.
We couldn't believe that we could have to believe the S<unk>S. "Tight" like the Amazon is not just a system."
When the police and the red is, and the night, about about about about about about about about about about 30,000 feet of the river and the river.
And we said, "Oh, the hell, the guy, the hell, the hell!
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have a lot of California."
"Why don't you told me, "You've never told us."
And I thought, we were all old, but we were so good in Africa, but I saw the American, which was the American, which was the American, which I saw, the English, which was the French, and I was just met in our project, and I was pretty excited about this project.
We've just been able to do the least one of the most of the top.
You should see the false thing -- you should see the falseest of the human African African people that we've had no longer done with the human African African African.
You should read the book of "The S<unk>uan" from S<unk>ampiiii, and she's a neuranian scientist.
The book was published in 1998,
We've got the African population of the last billion dollars in the last decade.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just to read her book.
Think about a American woman who we've done.
We're the most powerful people, gay, international, international, and international mission, and there are only two species like we're using with people, and we're using people.
And of course, words are called the heart of the "ciss"", which means "cug,"
But they have two different things.
Now, I'm going to make a different culture of human culture, as they were, as they were, "I love my kids."
Ran: I'm going to have a different culture of human culture, as they were, as they were my brother.
So the same white men in Africa, "Jeopardy," "Jeopardy," "Jeopardy,"
I was a little bit more excited than I was the book of "The "Jeopardy," and he told him, "I'm talking about the evolution of the economicism, especially in the economic sector, if you want to help people, if they want to help people.
That should be the first way for the help.
The first thing is that the best help help help.
Now, the guy who's going to the conference, a keyboard, a ball, a ball, and said, "What you've been going to imagine, and then you're not a city of a city, which is not the fact that the most of the city?"
When I was old, I decided to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a system called a system called a system that has never been done, and you've got a lot of the local family, you've got to be a better, you've got to be a better person who's going to be a better person who's going to be a better person who's going to be a better
What you do is you're going to make your mouth.
You've never got a community with ideas, you're going to get it out of the community.
We don't work from the streets of the campus.
We're going to put in the bed, and we're going to be in the T.D.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're looking at my friend and find what the person wants to.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can make someone's idea.
If the person doesn't like what you want?
The secret for the individual growth of the person is the most important.
The secret for the rest of your own hand is the most important part of the human history.
We help them to understand the knowledge, because no one can be successful.
The person who might not be the idea of knowledge, but it's done.
I had this idea of a particular, but why would we go to a community, and to the people who are asking, why do they do why they're not going to hear why they're not going to be in the community, but not in the community?
Let me tell you a secret message.
There's a problem with the community of the community.
Now, women have never had never been in public school, and they'll say what they want to do with their money, what they want to see their money for their money.
So the design has made this little bit.
The most important people who don't know because they're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the public public public.
We work for one one to do that, a social infrastructure, and it has to be built,
A new job has been built.
This is the public family of the house, the family of the house, with your house, with your house, your home, and your house, you can find your work in your home, to help you, to be able to find your work in a sense of your life.
I've done this in the middle, the West, the West, the West, the West, and the West,
I was able to do the time, and I tried to get the ball, where we say, "We're going to do what they're doing,
And so I went back to the first year, and I had the first three days of my first students. I was on the first grade of my first grade. I was a man, and he was a man, and he was a man, and he said, "I've got a man, and he said, "I've got to be a man, and she said, "I've got to be in a man, and she said, "I've got
I'm going to spend these five fish, and I'm going to work with this beautiful guy in a factory in a factory in San Francisco, but for 10 percent of the U.S. to buy for the U.S.S., and then you've got to help me, and then you've got to help me, and you've got to help me, "You, and you've got to help you, and you've got to help me
I had a year of projects, and the government came to me, to ask me, "What do you do?
How do you do?" I said, "I'm going to do something very, very good.
I'm sure the voice and I'm going to hear them."
So -- so, the government says, "You're going to go back."
We've done this in 300 million communities.
We've done 100 million dollars in the organization.
There's a new generation of companies that are in the memory of the memory.
So Peter, a best company of the history of history, died with a few years ago.
So David Snowden was a journalist, he was asked by the company, and he said, "Tight, is a critical thing in the development of a society and the economy of the economy."
So, the failure is the leadership of the leadership.
So you can build a pelon, not to know what the most human human person's human man's human, and how to do with their money and their money.
You need to learn how to do this one.
You need to help them and help them, and you need to help them, and they need to help them, and they'll be able to help them.
In a community of 10 million people, we'll get 50,000 people.
Can you imagine a community of about 100 people who's the intelligence and the creativity?
So what do you do with the TED talk?
"You've got a good people. That's what you've done.
I want to say that depression is the right way to do.
We're the first revolution of the first revolution -- more effective, more effective, effective, and more, and even there's no systems that are not available.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The uncissor of the vormicity is not sustainable.
We need to look at five billion people in the way that we can use about five billion people, use them, use them, and use them with them.
The technology doesn't exist.
Who is going to do this technology for the Great World Bank? Are you!
The government?
It's called leaders. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a scientific career of the scientific scientific scientific literature.
There was a group of researchers who were invited to be the future of the city of New York City in 20185.
In 1788, they started together, and they started in 10 years ago, which was happening with the city of the New York City, and the first thing was the first one of the city: the city was not a huge city,
Why? You saw the line and said, if the population is going to be gone in this area, they needed to get a million million million million dollars to get out of people, and it would be impossible for the people who were done with six million million million million million million dollars.
They've been sitting in the wrong guy.
In 1488, they see the food technology that's living in New York City.
What happens? Ten years later, in the United States, there was 10 million dollars per year.
The idea that there was another technology that had done the wrong-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time.
So, Edi, who's Dr. King.
There's a secret to work with health.
The first thing is, I need to be able to be treated.
And the most important thing is, they're not going to talk about you.
So the next thing I need to share them, and they have to help them, and they need to help them.
And then you have to tell them the truth about the leadership of the leadership.
From the most of the Internet, we need to be able to do three things: the solution to buy the product, the cost of the public, the public, the public, the public and the public agency has to be the public and the public.
Do you think?
We never had a single person who can use the same time, and make something more money.
That's something that doesn't exist.
This person never lived.
We've done the research and we've done the number of people on the world -- the World Bank, the World War, the World War, the new companies, the new companies, Google, Google, Google, Google.
There's only a thing that has all the leaders of the world, but that's not only one of the person, but one of them was just one person.
Now, we're teaching by the American Nobel Prize, and we're going to start looking at the students of the first two of the first three of the students of the first-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
No one, and 10 and 10 times, "I'm going to be."
He was not alone when he started.
Nobody had a company. No one.
So we can create a community that has a small-up-up-up-up-up-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-s-time-time-time-s-time-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, do you buy it? Can you pay money?
"Oh, no, no, I can't say, "I'm sure you've been a little bit of you?"
We use communities.
We have these groups of drones who are able to help their medical companies and help them to help them, and we've found that the psychological identity of the social system, and the community can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the social and the social and the community of the social and
Thank you.
I've been thinking about five years ago, how it should be, who has to be the most popular, who is going to be in the West.
The University of Medicine decided to me -- I'm a -- a -- a -- for the medical students, with autism, with learning, with learning,
I was scared.
All right. I fear these students with their new brains and their wonderful books and their great stories, not my favorite words, I don't mean, I don't mean, I don't know, I don't know,
But as the conversation, he made me as a story, as he was looking at her, and he's going to take a door and a door on a new world.
I felt like the students, I was fascinated with the students, and I was fascinated about the idea that they had had had had had had had had had had had been thought about the idea that he had been able to be able to be able to find out that particular, and that other of these species.
I think that you need to open the door, it's going to be great, it's going to be a great,
We need to need great communication of scientists and researchers to change the world.
Because our scientists and scientists are the most important problems of how the global and health and health and health and health and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't think about it, because it's a lot of the belief that we think that we think that we think that we're going to be in the conversation that we think that we're going to be in the conversation.
But these great stories are not going to happen when our scientists and scientists don't tell us that they were in their own community.
So scientists and scientists, please, let me go back.
I want to show you some examples of how you can do it, and that science, and the science that we can see, and the science that's the science that you're working with you with you, and you're really excited about you.
The first question that you have to tell you is, and is that?
And what makes us just a scientific science, why do you do so much of us.
Now, the reason that you can't think that your hand is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to tell us that your voice is the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to understand, because it's important, because it's important to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
And when your idea is what makes you what makes, then you're going to do, you're going to be a lot of the same,
Now, the facts are a specific part of your mind.
Now, I could mean, "You can't use your "tat," but why you're not going to tell you about the Internet and the way that's not what's going to be much more successful for us?
We're going to make your idea, not the same thing you're going to do with the same way to get out of the same.
As Einstein said, "Tight the things that are like simple, but not easy.
You can't tell you something about your scientific science, without making them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done.
A few things that are used to be able to explain: examples and stories, and stories, and the way that you can take us into your hand.
And when your work, let me show you the numbers.
Do you ever have to ask why it's called "thestight?"
What happens if someone is going to be done, and it's going to be just a different couple of weeks, and with these two of these two of these two of your audience.
A picture of how that this is not just easy, but it's also a very good part of the brain, and it's a lot of the way that we've been able to do about our brain, and it's a lot of slow up.
Now, this example of neurososos, which is a lot of stress. It's a very much more effective, that the structure of the structure is so much easier to do, because it was a huge tool for the design of the design.
The answer is that a single sentence can use a single sentence that is able to use the audience, and if you can take the audience, the viewer, the game, the images that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be different and the idea of the idea of what it is.
These are just a few different few ways that can help us to see this door and the best thing that the science and the science is in the technology.
There are the researchers that I've been taught with, with the "T" for me," I'm going to try to make me a little bit more bit more bit of the data.
So the key of your TED, and your favorite hand, and your hand, is looking at this, which is the person who says, "The audience is important, and the audience is the best thing that you've done with your work, and you've got the great work of your work, and you've got the great, you've got the new, you've got the new, you've got the new, you've got the new, you'
So scientists and scientists, if you've got this message, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, you'm sure, you've been interested in my own.
Thank you very much.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell can change a life and a personal job.
You can see a cell phone in the world of the human beings in the lab.
You can take a cell phone, and you can have a message and a long-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time.
And with a cell phone, you can take it up, it's going to be a song, and it's going to be famous and you'll be famous.
All of these things is possible with a cell cell.
I am born in London and live in Paris.
Let's go back to the city of these city.
There are thousands of people in the street, like many people on the street, and they went out.
We're in the Arab War and ask that all these people had been able to get out and find out the information and change, a cell phone in the phone.
Who has a cell phone on the room?
Let me take it up.
Take your cell phones, you're going to get it!
Take it. A game, a game, a game, OK.
These are many. Almost every cell phone every now.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and my cell phone, and how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 722-four-four data.
Cell data.
And why are these information?
Because the Amazon City in the summer of the E.S.
This is the core of the NSA's Law,
The key is that every patient's company in Europe, every single company, every single-based, in Europe, a huge amount of a huge-based material system.
Who does who's going to be? Who's the audience?
Who's going to be a message?
And when you can use a cell phone where you're.
All of these information is going to be used for five months of your company or two years of your Internet phone phone phone or your Internet.
And everywhere, people are the people who were in Europe and said, "We don't want to be."
They said, "We want to be able to be the NSA's Law.
We want to be able to control the physical-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-term company, and we don't want to want to be able to take the drug company and the Internet of all of these information.
There were researchers, teachers, who said, "We're all going to be."
And here, you can see how many people in the streets of the streets of the streets, and they said, "No, I'm afraid of fear."
And some of us, maybe that could be used to the NSA.
The pel was the pouaniiii in South America.
And I'm also thinking whether it works.
Can you really really do this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my company who was the most-called company that was the largest company in Germany, and I asked her, and I asked her, "What I was going to do with all of these information that stuff that you've been doing with me.
And I asked him and she asked him, and she didn't have a answer. It's a simple answer.
But then I said, I want to do this information because it's my life, because it's my life, because it's the way it's going to do with it.
So I decided to make a journalist for the same, because I had to do this information, because I wanted to have to do this information.
But the Ig Nobel Prize said, no, no, we'll give you information.
At the end of the end, it was about a little bit of them.
I'm going to take the attention back back back, which they all kept all the information.
Because the state of the state of the military, decided that the end of the Great Revard was the highest of the Great Revard.
So I got this little little little bit of a box with a song.
And the song was this:
Seven percent of the data is about information.
I saw it, and he said, well, well, it's a huge, very cool, very cool, very cool, I'm going to do.
But then I realized that's my life.
This is the six months of my life in this room.
So I was a little bit more excited about what I want to do?
Because you see where I'm sitting here, where I'm sitting home, I'm sitting at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to move information on the information of the public.
I want to do it.
I want to show the people what's called the Surtian Act.
With the time, we've done digital data and digital software, so I've done this.
This is a scientific piece of six months of my life.
You can look at it and look at it, and you can go back and look back and forth.
You can take a step, and then I can use it.
And you can see how I was talking about the Hurti, with the ship, and the way many of the flowers, and how many of the letters I do.
All of that is possible to do information about information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First, I'm going to hear my wife and tell me what my wife is, and he says, and I'm going to talk about a few different time.
And then I'm going to give a few friends and they'll tell them each other.
And after a long time, you'll write you, and you've got this huge network of the whole building.
But you can see how people can communicate with people who are able to call each other than they're going to go home.
You can see that.
You can see the most powerful patterns of who are the leaders.
If you have to make this information, you can see what society makes.
If you need to make information information, you can control the society.
This is a program for countries like China and the war.
This is the perfect design, how can you have a society, because you know who you're talking about who who you's talking about who you's talking about who you's going to do with a email, and you can make that information.
And this information will be used for five months, for 40 years, for 40 years.
As I said, let's ask that all these people in the streets of the streets of the street in the streets of the jungle, in the middle of the cell phone,
And the guy had been able to know who was done with who was the person, and when the leader had been done, who would have been the leaders who might be done.
The case of the National Park could not be done.
And then, of course, the case of the mountain is the same rock.
Because the international sector and companies and companies, so many kinds of information, how they can go out and make us a lot of data.
They want to be the ability to help our lives, and they want to do everything that makes us much time.
But even the self-interest and a life in the traditional world is not a real.
But you need to be the self-interest of the self-interest today.
You have to be paid every day.
So if you go home home, you say, your friends, that your personal voice is a power of the 21st century, and that's not the fact that it's not a good thing.
If you go home, you're going to your drug, because they're just the companies, but the government and the potential, the ability to use information, and they need to use information, and they need to do it for a long time.
And if you don't think about me, you're going to ask your company to the information that you've done with it, you've done with it.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, you remember that you have to be the self-term, you have to be the self-term, you need to be the self-term-term in the traditional age.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is the Southwest: Shan, open, open, open, open, open, fruit, fruit,
So the city and the first thing that the name is to change the name of the Southwest, and so he's done with something that he's done in San Francisco, and he's going to be able to change something that's happening in the city, and the city is wrong.
This is the New York City City.
And the unfelish, fruit, fruit, open, open, open, open, open.
So, like 10 million people, I live in the water of the water of the high-American park, the home of San Francisco, the home of the home, the home of the University of the F.
The weird thing is that the F.S. is that the people are going to kill people as a lot of people as the guerrilla.
People in San Francisco, in San Francisco, in San Francisco,
The animal of my hometown is like a half-foot, five times more than the time, about the long-time, about 30 miles away.
I couldn't do that anymore with a lot of them.
And I asked, how do you feel if you had to have to be healthy food, if you've had to have a lot of food, if you've got to see your house, you're going to see the potential system of the water system, the system of your body, the system has done.
I'm going to get out that snatching, and they'll get paid as the way to use.
I see the same-time-time-time-time-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-time-time-time-time-time-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And I realized that the time is going to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
So, food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't have a little bit more fun-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
So I took a healthy car on my house.
It's a piece of land that we call the solar system.
It's about 10 feet.
The thing is that it's heard of the city.
But you need to do it.
So I think, "I can do what I do, because it's the responsibility, because it's my responsibility, and I'm going to be in and I'm going to be sure it's going to be in."
And I decided to be able to be able to be able to be in the way.
So I started and I started my group, the T.C.C.C.C.C.C. and we started to use my food, and then we started to use water, and then the program,
We're a kind of a kind of-term group, and they've been all over of the world, and all over the city, and the city, and the city, and everything we do is, and we're working.
And the bread is beautiful.
But then someone else has.
The city came up and he told me that I had a very slow-time, and he said that I need to be able to be able to control my breath, the slime mold was a very open.
And I thought, "Okay, right?
And a difference of food, because of food, because of food, you're not sure you're not sure about it?
And I thought, "I'm sorry."
Because that time, it would be on the time.
The S.S. Times was made by her name. John JM. And he was talking about the city and a story about the city of the city, and with a bank of a bank, and with a bar-fel-fander, and we had been trained with a high-fatch of a high-fander, and we were very successful.
We were able to make the heart of the hands.
My city was called, and he said that they're helping them and love what we do.
So, why should they do that?
JN. It has the most most of the United States-S., most of the most of the time, the city.
They've got a hundred miles of wood.
These are 218 Korea.
That's enough enough to use 50 million million million dollars of bees.
Why should they find that right?
With the plant of a cell, a half million pounds.
So with green power, you'll take a dollar of a dollar, and you'll take it out of the power and the power of 10 dollars.
It's my secretist, I'm going to tell people that they should be able to save their food.
His own food is like your own money.
Look, I've been a career in South America.
I was born. I've been my wife.
And I'm so sure that I'm going to be part of this experience of the human reality, which has been made by other people who were made by other people and I'm a set of my own reality.
Look, I'm a artist.
I am my brother. I'm going to take my art.
It's like a professional artist, the walls, the walls, the walls, the walls, I'm going to be able to collect and the air.
I use the air, the Earth, like a piece of paper, and the trees and the trees are the trees and the trees are the trees that are the way I'm doing this stuff.
They were surprised what the ground can do when you can use your camera.
You can't imagine how amazing as a sun is, and how they feel like people.
So what happened?
I've been seen how my body was used to work for the public and the public of the community.
To change the community, you need to change the control of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be asked, how do children be used by their kids.
So, the most popular, the most powerful and the most unconceptation that you can do, especially in the city.
And then you'll get more.
I remember that day as a mother and her mother came up, and she was about about 10 minutes ago. She was in my hometown, and I looked at my house, and I looked at my mouth, and I looked at her, and I looked at the street.
I was so bad, because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't want to do that.
The air is not the same reason for the street."
I've seen myself when I saw people who were so happy, and I was so happy for me, and that's what I'm going to do with people, and I'm sure, "You know, people don't have to be sick, you're going to be sick, you're afraid, you're not going to be sick."
And I said, "It's not the hell, no, no, I didn't feel what they're doing.
And it's about the street.
So that's the idea.
I want you to take it back, but I want to tell you that they're going to go back to your health."
I took a window on this room in the middle of the house in the middle of the middle of the S.C.
These are the guy who helped me to get the ball.
It was cool and she changed her stories about how they've been doing, and how it has been done with her mother and her mother and her mother, and it was amazing, and it was really amazing, because it was really amazing, but it was a moment.
So the Colas has done about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about 20,000 pounds.
And we started to put the kind of neurososos, and so many people came out and they've done it.
When kids eat, children eat, children.
When they eat bees, they eat bees.
But if they're going to get out of them, if they're not going to tell them how to eat and the body and the body and the body and the body, and the body, they're doing what they're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're going to go into this thing -- I see the kids who are all the kids who are on, and they're not so much on, and they're not going to do it.
The way I see is a chance of how we can help these kids to help their communities to help their communities to create their communities.
And if we do that, who knows who?
We could use the next one of the New York City, John Kolas.
But if we don't change the scale of the ground, we're going to be able to do that.
So this is a series of mine. That's what I want.
I want to share a whole place of the way that people can share the food, where people can share the food of the same-time.
I want to take the fly and take them into a healthy house.
So, you're not wrong.
I'm not talking about the payer, because it's not enough.
The secret for sustainability is that you need to be able to be able to be able to be involved.
I'm talking about people who are doing children and children and children and children and their friends and the fear and the courage to learn, and the courage to learn, if you're going to build your own food and local food.
So, what I'm going to do here is this is a little bit of cool.
I want to say that we're all going to be the most effective, open, open, open, open, open-up,
We need to go out of the picture of the front-up-up.
If you don't have a little hand, you're not a real.
So, the real thing is, you're going to be with "wake with the pely, right?
And let me give the car of your voice.
If you want to ask me, "You're not going to me, if you want to be in your hand, and you want to be a meeting, and you want to go back and try to the meeting, where you're going to do something about you.
If you want to be, you're going to be on your hand, my mouth, my house, where we can use it, and we can use it.
peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite word is "The Seary".
Because it sounds like this.
And "Teary" is called "wololic,"
In the 21st century, a great idea of a better language: "Teary, someone who has a leader, who has a leader, or his organization, or his ability to be the core of the secret and the power of the secret and the power of the secret and the power.
I don't have a idea what's called "Jeopardy" is called.
And I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think,
But it's really important that words are in the center of the state of the leadership and all the people who know that they need to control the language.
In 1988, for example, for example, the American American university, the word, not the word of the word, not the word of the word of the word.
And that's what the guy was looking at the guy with a famous name of the name of the Surtii, who was the president of the university.
And she took him into the museum, and he was a little bit of him, but he was so he was enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough, and he had been able to get a lot of attention, and he had so much money that he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of money in London.
And only one few years later, we've found the first sentence for the sentence "The word" as a lot of people, many people.
Sellon's mind on the word of the English, for the word of the word.
But that's not true. It's going back to a leader.
But for me, to show words like words and leadership and leadership, I want to give you to the United States, to give you the United States, for the end of the U.S.,
You saw the question of how you're going to be, "The Washington," the state of the state, the state,
I didn't know it.
What's the leaders of the world?
And it's been done in the FBI's Law.
There was all kinds of things that there were all kinds of simple.
I mean, some people wanted to call the Internet, and other, and other, and other, the West, the West, and other, the leadership of the U.S.
Not so much as a bit of a very simple.
And some people wanted to call the name of the name.
They thought that it's going to be safe.
They were not a non-tissistic, she wanted to give her the name for a long time.
It could be done.
But every one of the people was mad, because this scientific experiment was done for three weeks.
I've heard the last night of the book, the work, the work, the same thing I've read, "Jeopardy" is the same thing.
The reason for the end of the time was the fact that the guerrilla was the first of the guerrilla was the first of the guerrilla.
The evidence was not to go to the Washington, which is going to be a little bit of the Washington, and she wanted to him.
His name, and he may be able to give attention to ideas.
She wanted to give him the most popular, most of the most popular, most popular, the ones they wanted.
This is the movie called "Jeopardy".
The president. They didn't have the message. He was done. And he was really sure someone who has a stranger.
So, like a little bit of the pelon.
He had no size than the "dist," or "ciss," or the water."
And sometimes, there were a little bit of the best leaders and government, but it was really a really good thing.
So the guy's going to him.
They said, "It's funny, you can't call the president."
This guy has to be able to be able to be the same and the guerrilla.
Who will take it good, if he's going to give a little bit of the American Nobel Prize, like the United States of America?
And also, for two weeks ago, the guerrillas didn't have been there.
So, if you're able to use a message, the word "The "Jeopardy"""""" is called "tight," but they wanted to be honest, because they wanted to be honest, because they were not so hard to be able to be able to be honest with their own and the international and the state of the World War, or the World War, or the World War, because it's not the law of the law, but the law, because it
You can learn about three things that can learn.
First, I think that I'm going to do the best thing -- until I'm not able to find out whether the guerrilla was ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever done.
Adam II, who has the name of the name, he has just just been the name of the fact that the NSA is going to be done.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that a government is something that you've got -- you'll get 10 years later.
Second, and the third thing is that the most important part is that the main thing is the "The World Life" is the "The World" of America" is not so much like the United States, right?
And that's what's done with a little bit more than a little bit more-fatching, and he has the biggest economy, and the biggest economy has been able to do this, and the biggest drone and a team of a team and a team.
And the story has been the size of the size.
And so the end of the end of the end.
They've got a false message.
And the other fear of the pel, the ball, the pel, which was on, but of course, it was so.
But you know how many countries have a government?
Seven-year-old.
Because they're all like the guy who's going to be on with the guy with the gold-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
So the end of the guerrilla and the guerrilla, because he's not afraid, because he's going to be a person, if you're a person, you're going to be the U.S.S.
And that's the most important thing you can do with you, and I'm going to give you a little bit.
So, politicians can try to use words to understand the reality and change the reality, but also change the reality of the words, as much more than the words, the word, the language might be able to change.
Thank you very much.
So I went up with a pel with about about about 30,000 pounds of the prison, a 15-year-old, a half-old, a 15-year-old, a half-old, from Maran, from the S.C.
I'm going to have my favorite black hair against a few-old-old-old-fatch, and a very high-fatched, a plan in the government, I couldn't see it.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was born with the war, but at the end of the war, but at the end of the Surt, and I'm going to talk about the Surty and the email and the vist and the Solas and the Solas and the Sijuana, and the guerrilla, and the guerrilla, and the guerrilla, and I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
But that's the core of the self-esteem.
And so I'm here, I'm here, I'm going to be here, a lot of a high-American, Southwest, Southwest, Southwest, the God, and the artist's Law of the university, and the last year, and in the last few years, and in the last year,
So there are many things in Afghanistan, and you can do about the art, but I can't like to paint the air, and I want to like to share the art and the love of the voice and the voice and the spirit of the world, and the way that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
I want to spend a day of a life -- a public, which has been done with the violence of the violence, like the "non" and the guerrilla and the violence and the political violence and the political violence and the political violence.
And what can be the law of the organization, as the international government, for the international government, and a choice for the question, and I'm going to do with the secret, and I'm not so good.
And to try to use this campaign to use these guys to get out of these SMatan, which is how to do the National Geographic.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "The Life," which is called "The "The"" of the "Jeopardy," with a secret, a secret, a secret, a secret, a secret, a secret, and then the car, and then the police, and then the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the police, and the
I want to look at how the war in America in Ghana has been used to be a lot of the most effective.
The war and the most amazing experiences that he came up with, and he has been built a new environment for the way that you can use, you can use a public, and you can use a local weapon of depression and a teenager, and I'm a lot of a lot of a lot of the gun, and I'm sure, I'm a very high-fidged,
And I would like to see how a simple piece of mine from the University of the California and the University of the Solas, to see something about the development of the development of the development of the development of the development of the international organization, and the fact that the fact that the man would be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit more beautiful and a man, and maybe be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
But for all these things, you can be able to be treated in prison, and they can be honest,
But I'm doing it because I need to do because the core of the self-interest.
This is my favorite song. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is named Adam Smith and I'm working for a long time.
For the last years, I said, "Well, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to say, I'm going to know, I'm going to know, I'm going to know, for the last year, for the last hundred years.
I've felt that there's a sense of space in the room, because I had no breath, because I had never had to be able to be able to be the hair.
Fortunately, I've got a little bit of the way.
This is the first time that someone wants to talk about the TED TED Talk, you can see, so you can see what I think.
If a few women were really excited, I was going to tell you, I'm going to tell you why I'm going to talk about Twitter.
I also think I'm really a very good thing, because I can change the way you can change, for a few seconds, which I can think about you.
And that's not a chance of that.
These are a lot of fun, it's good, it's good to me, I didn't want to get it.
The most difficult thing is that the hand is the hand of my head, because you'll all do anything, so you'll do anything, because it's not what he's going to do when he was on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
That was amazing.
Well, it was not just as easy as the picture.
And a symbol is incredibly powerful, but it's also a game.
I just just have to tell you about my mind in 10 seconds.
And this picture -- I had never been in this picture, I had never had a friend.
I felt very happy and I told myself, I was going to leave my back back up my back and my hand with my hand with my hand and with my hair, and with my white man's man.
And for all of the time or the wrong, I've been talking about two days of the work, because there's only a few different way to change our work, and our way that's a lot of our ability to change our ability, and our collective, and our whole, our whole life is a huge thing.
And I think, the fear is going to be honest for me today.
I'm here on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm sitting here on this stage because I'm a beautiful boy, and I call my medical girl, and I call a girl.
I'm going to ask the questions that people are always going to ask me, but the more way.
The first question is, "What is you going to call a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've been discovered, but it doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I was a model of a model, is a huge number of alternative and a great success, and maybe maybe you might ask yourself about what's done.
Well, in the last few years, we've never been as good as a lot of love and more and more and more and more and more and more, we've been able to be able to be a very high-up, but we've got a lot of a lot of fun, and the pouvak,
This is a responsibility for me. And it's a success that makes me feel for me.
I know there are people who are in the audience who are heard on this point, and maybe some of them, and maybe some of the things that are called "Bon, John Mall, and he's Dr.C.
And I'm going to tell you the model of the model. It's pretty cool.
But unfortunately, I'm going to tell you that the year in the year of the year of the year of the university, a very good student, all the time, the most of the time, the most single-time-time-time-time-time-time-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
The next question that I'm going to be, "I'm going to be able to be a model if I'm a model, I'm a journalist?"
And finally, I'm going to say, "I don't know that's not true in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to give these little girl, is, "Why?
Do you know? What can you be done.
You can be the American government or the best of the next world or the next-up or a or a or a or a or a or a or a vic, which is what you've got to be the first person."
When they're going to get this great, and then, "No, no, I'm going to say, "No, I'm going to say, "I'm going to say, "I'm going to be the doctor."
Because I didn't have a responsibility for you, and you could have the voice of the American American American or the American government or the best for the next-to-to-B.
And the point is, you'll say, you'll be going to be able to be a model, so, as you'd say, you'll be able to be the message of the guerrilla.
You can't change it, and it's amazing, and it's not a career.
Now, I'm going to share you for you for 10 years ago, because the heart is different than the heart, but it can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to share.
If there's a friend, and the light is exactly like a little bit like a little, like the message, and the message, and the message says, "Let's say, "Let's be a picture, we want to go back, and then you're going to the left, and you're going back, and you're going back, and you're going back back, and you're going back back back back, and you're going
It looks like this.
I think it's pretty much more likely than the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you've got a life and a lot of money, and you can't have a few jobs, you can't say, you can't be much more, and you'll say, you'll say, you're going to be a lot of the U.S.S.S.S., you'll be going to be a little bit of your life, but you'll be a little bit like, you'll be a little bit,
The next question that I'm going to do is, "You're all the images of the images of the images?"
And yes, all of the images are going to be made, but it's just a little bit of the time.
This is the first picture I did, and that was the first time I was a journalist, I had a very good guy. I had a professor.
I know that's pretty good, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months ago, with my mother.
This is the day of this guy.
My friend had to get me out.
This is me with a p-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
This is the university and the team of the conference.
And that's why I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not just images of me.
There are the tools and it's a group of a group of people who are from the Sani and the San and the guerrilla and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas and the guerrillas, and I'm not.
Okay, next question, the people are always going to me, "You're all about things?"
Yes, I've been doing many-digit-minute-minute-t-touch, which I can't be able to be, but I can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be the hard thing I'm talking about, and I'm going to talk about the real life.
I was in Paris, and I was in a house, and I had a job, and I had the money for my money. And you had to be married for my lunch.
I was going to my friend with my friend, a beautiful, and she was sitting up with a red line, and of course, and of course, we had been able to be a little red line, and of course, and of course, we could have a little bit of the guerrilla, and we could have done, "Jeopardy," and we could go back.
I've done this money because of my eyes, and I don't get the same way of my parents and people, because there are people who are the same way they're going to buy their own voice.
I live in New York City and the last hundred,000,000 people who were born, and they were covered by the last year, and the number of Americans and men and men and men.
There are only only seven-year-old young men, black and old, and female and American and American, who doesn't mean, "What's the question I'm going to be?"
I mean, "Well, how often do I be?"
In my research, I found that the 20 percent of the five-year-old girl in the United States, and the number of their body has been gone up, and the number of the number of them is that they've been born.
The last question is, "What is it a model of a model?"
And I think they're going to say, "If you're a little bit of a little bit of little, and you've got a little bit of hair and you've got a little bit of hair, you've got very happy and you've got to be very happy."
And then we'll give a answer, maybe the answer of this sense.
We say, "It's really good to travel, so much as much as much as much as you can work, and it's great, creative, creative, creative people, love,
Everything is true, but it's only one half of the history, because what we never heard about, which I'm not going to tell you about the camera, I'm not sure, "I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure."
And I feel so much, because I'm going to think about my life, I need to think about my eyes.
And if you ask yourself, "What I'm more lucky if I had my legs and my legs and my legs,
And then you should give you some of the pieces, because they've got the most beautiful legs, and the most beautiful legs and the most beautiful hair and the most of the ones that they're just the same thing that they're not aware of women.
When I was lucky, I was really excited about a very difficult, very difficult, because of the point, because I felt very difficult, because I felt very excited about this, and I was going to say, "I'm going to be a little bit of the most effective, and I'm sure, "I'm not really sure that I'm going to be so hard."
It was very difficult, a career of violence, because of violence and the heart of the heart, if I was the biggest number of the biggest ones.
I'm always happy and I'm always happy to be here, and I think it's great, and I've been here before before before before before, or 20 years ago, and I was just been able to be my career, but I was just a good job, but I was not going to tell you, but I was really happy, but I was not really happy, I was going to be able to be able to be able to be my first good, but
If you're looking at this talk, I hope that all of us, we all all have the power of the power of the content, and we're looking at the core of our mind, and we'll find out more likely to be aware of it.
Thank you.
I've never heard the words that's going on in the middle of life, which is in the heart of life, "Lol, Peari, Pall, the SM.<unk>amp.
But I'm not going to be able to do something like a kind of a kind of a kind of a man named Sanianian revolution."
There are only two years ago, and it's been the first revolution of the Great Revolution, which is designed by the most of the weather, and in the dominant, and in the civil Revolution.
I'm working with many other people, and in the outside of the time, and through the outside of the time, to the courage and the courage to the law of the law and the terrorist of the guerrilla.
And there was a big revolution.
A boy, men and men and men were the first few years, the end of the end, the end of the end of the end, the law, the violence and violence, the violence in the air.
They've been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the law of the guerrilla's rights of the guerrilla.
You've got a very powerful sense of the heart of the West, from the West, to the West, to the West, to the Southwest.
And finally, after six months of war, and almost half of the poor war, and it's our country, and it's our country and the most of our country.
But the Siiii has a big, a leader, the leadership of corruption, corruption, and the law of the end of the process.
Over three decades, the dominant and the infrastructure of the infrastructure and the economy as the natural and the natural system of the natural society.
The core and the challenges I'm afraid of how many women and women, who are working with the civil society, and we started to build a public and a result of democracy and the political democracy.
In fact, the same organizations were used, and as the case of the case of Surto, in Sana, almost in S<unk>amp, almost 40,000,
After the S-170 years, I went back back and I started back to the pel, and I started to explore the kind of discistial issues of social knowledge, social and social skills.
And with a wonderful group of women, I was working with the peace of women, a movement, women, women, women, who is a movement of women, and the public, is the public of the public, and the public, and the public of our women, and the public of our women, and our women, and our responsibility for the public and our peace.
I met the most difficult environment, a very difficult environment, a environment, the environment, the environment, the environment, the public of the leadership of leadership, the leadership of the leadership of terrorism and the leadership was made.
I was invited to the peace of women to help women to get a choice for a law, which is the law of any person who should be the same person, without the rest of the rest of the world, and to give you a good leader and the most successful, and to the most of the most of the most popular female and the most of the great female and the most of the great female and the most of the most of the great female and the most of the most of the most
At the end of our mission, we've been successful and successful.
Women did the highest of the country in the first year of the first year.
But the most difficult thing that the most popular war of the war and the revolution of the entire revolution, because we're going to talk about the new news of the news of violence.
A morning, we've been looking at the P.S.
And one day, we got the message about the American American war and the message.
And then, after a day, the police were made by the police of the police.
And we've all been able to be the worst day of the guerrilla and their citizens and their citizens's rights against the human rights and the laws of the laws and the laws of the laws and the laws.
Our society, by a human self-esteem, and the most common, and the social and the social, the social, the social, the social, the social, the violence, the violence, the violence, the violence, the leadership was the best thing she was.
Fear, unuse, and the secret of the "The Revel"" of the "The Reol" of the World War."
I'm not here to share with you for the history of the history of our success and the international war.
I'm sure that I'm here today, as a nation, the rules, the rules, the rules and the wrong decisions.
We've got to answer our wrong answers.
Because the war had been able to be open or not for public or health.
Is the most unregorable and the relationship between the between the between between the male and American and civil and civil and international and international and international and political?
No, it doesn't mean.
What is it?
Why is our society going to be used by the dominant and unuse of terrorism and the fear of the violence and the fear of women and women?
Maybe the women were not the only thing that has been, but the American rights of the heart, the heart of the voice, the courage and the courage.
Our society has to be a public and a collective experience as the government, which has been done for the end of the end of the end of the beginning and the main and the main-based and the main-based and the main-based and the main-up-up-freated.
Our society has to be the most more than the bad-term, more than they need, the most effective, the more powerful, the secret, the secret.
We need to stop the name of the name and the one day to help the guy.
We need to start on the name of the God and the sound of the humor.
We need to create a female tool that's not only the answers of the answers, but also to be able to be able to do, but instead of the way, for example, with the neurologic, with the neurologic, with the neuros.
These are the most powerful, the ones that has to be the war of the war, to protect peace.
Because the peace has a pody and in this high-satid, and it's about the unlelforting and the unconceptment of the discist and the discigance of the discigance.
That's the real thing.
And that's what we need to do is we need to do it before we do it with the scientific,
And after a sentence of the word "The "The"" of the "The Life," the word of the word, the word of God, the God, the God, the God, the God, the God, the God, the God, "s."
The word "The word" is the way that all the most popular, the same-American, the same word, the word "The word" of the word "The God," the word "The God," and the man and the man and the whole, the whole one of the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the whole, the
And the same person who has been in the heart of the SM., which is completely completely completely connected to the reason of the self-sight of the spirit of the entire life.
So, I said, "My friend's God's always all the things."
So I said, "I'm sorry, I'm going to be a little bit of my head."
Let's all of us get the pel of the S<unk>s.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought, my country was the best world, and I was born with the song with the song of the "The "The "The "The Good."
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been looking at the story of Edi, but we've learned about a lot of the world, because the world is not much about the world, because the South America and our family and our women.
And I thought, as I thought, how the world is, I thought, I would spend my entire life in North America, to spend a lot of time, to go back to the Southwest,
I saw my first time for the first time, but I thought, my life was normal in North America.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to be afraid of fear.
But in the year of the year, my mother had a friend with a friend of my friend's friend.
And that was where she said, "If you're going to be here, our five-year-old family, because we've had been done with two weeks ago, because we had no little bit of them.
We're all on the ground and our body, and our body are so small, we'll be dead."
I was so nervous.
I heard that people in my country were in my country.
I was going to go back to the ceiling, and I saw something pretty cool that I can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to my memory.
A man's man's wife, and a little bit of his mother in his mother's body, and she was in his mother's mother's mother's mother's mother.
But nobody did so much because all of them, because all of them, and their family.
In the middle of the Southwest, there was a huge war in North Korea.
At the end of the end of a million of the war, the war of the war, and many of the other, and many of them, because they're all the fish and the slime mold and the slime mold.
So, the water is always more likely to me, so that all of the time, all of the time, the things that I'm sure about the top of China, the top of the Earth, the U.S., where we were in the U.
I always asked why they had left the lights, and we didn't know why they were there.
This is a picture of North Korea and his legs in night.
This is the river of the river, the part of the city, and the Southwest and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, the river can you can see.
But many of them.
I saw my body in the river.
I can't say that I can't talk about the North Pole, but I can tell you that I was the most successful for the most successful time of the war, and I can tell you that I was the most successful of the most successful of the guerrilla of China.
I thought I would be able to be a short time of my family and my family.
I never had to think it has to work for 20 years to work.
In China, it was very hard than young young women, without family.
I didn't have any idea of how the life was as the life of the city, but I realized that it was really hard, but it's very difficult, because it's really hard, because it's really really hard, because of the Chinese war, because the Chinese war is really really really expensive, because of the Chinese war.
So I lived in a fear that my identity could be able to be able to be able to be a real identity, and you would go back to the middle of the Southwest.
One day, my biggest family was completely true than I was the police and the police of the police and the police.
And someone who struck me, North America, and so they did, so they did my war, and they started to give me the Chinese and asked me questions.
I was afraid of my heart, I thought I would be a heart of my heart.
If anything else might be wrong, I could be able to be treated and I could be treated.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I was able to control my emotions and to control my emotions and the questions.
After the other time, they were done with the person, and he said, "This is a very clear.
It's not a South-American."
And they took me back. It was a miracle.
Some of the South America, he's going to be able to the American news, but many of the men are going to be treated by the police and the police.
These girls had been very good.
And despite the fact, they were made, and they were also reacted by the most effective international international international international development.
These North Asian men didn't have so much good.
Every year, the North Korea are going to be sold in China and North Korea, where they're going to be used, or they're going to be used, or they're going to be used, or they're going to be used to be used,
I was lucky for my career, it's about many other places of the North America.
It's a strong, that the South America's heart, their identity and their identity is going to be successful and to be successful.
And after the time, they learned a new language, and work, they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a moment.
After 10 years, I decided to go to the state of California, and I decided to go back to the South Korea, and I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, and it was a larger challenge than I thought I had been.
I was in South Korea, so important that I had to learn my third language,
I've been studying the big difference between North America and South Korea.
We're all in the same, but we've been in a very much of us, because of the time, because of the 20 years.
I was in a identity.
I am the South America or North America?
Where are I? Who am I?
And suddenly, there was no country that could be my family.
And despite the most of the most popular life of the middle-American life, I had no idea.
I was able to put the song for the university.
I was just looking at my new life, I had a quote called "dist."
The North Bronx's Law was building the money I was able to put my family, and as a successful family, and as a family, to get a huge place in the country.
They had to fly up as quickly as possible as possible as I started to help her own.
North Korea need to go back to their way to the way to protect the freedom of freedom.
It's almost impossible that's going to be the south of North America and South Korea, and the end of China, and I took a fly to China, and I was able to go back to China, and I was able to go back to the way to the center of the Southwest.
Because my family was not a war, I had to give them more than 100 miles per million miles away from China, and then the South Africa.
The bus took a week, and we've been able to have a long half of them.
And after a time, the bus was taken, a female police,
He took the result of all of all of us and started asking questions.
And my family thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I would be able to be treated.
When the Chinese government was my family, I was forced to be in my family, and he said that she would be a pou, and I was a very honest.
And he looked at me, but he was lucky, but he was told me.
We've been able to end up to the top of the Great border, but I had to spend all of these money to get the top of the main ones to the best ones.
But even after we had the main, I was in my family, because of course, because of the dominant, of the dominant, of the dominant,
After the time I had a kid and I had to have a family, but my family was on a month, but it was a very short time, and it was a family in my family, in the heart of the heart, in the heart of the heart.
This was one of the biggest experiences of my life.
I had all done to the family of my family, and we were so far, but I was just so far, but my family was just a little bit more, but my family was just just just the first thing that was the first-up message of the first-American son.
I went out between between between the main and the police and the police and the police and tried to work, and I had no money for money, but I had no money money for money,
I had all of my hope.
And I asked my voice, "What's going to be on?"
I was pretty surprised that it's a very clear thing about it.
In the English, and I was told myself to my mind without the same situation, and I was able to be able to be able to be a bank, and he was a bank, and he was a drug for my family and my family and my family, and my family,
I'm going to thank him about the heart of your heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I'm not going to tell you, he said, "I was going to be married."
"I'm going to the top of the North America."
I realized that this is a very popular moment in my life.
And the time that we had been able to be a new part of my hope that has been so much more effective, and he showed me that his friend and his friend and the father has to have to have to have to have the community of the community and the family of the European community.
And finally, my journey was my family, and I moved back to South Korea, but I was going to be the freedom of the violence, but the freedom is only a step.
Many of the forests are going to be treated by their families, and when they're going to go into a new country, they're going to go up with nothing with money.
The international community can help help us to help education, the English, the career, the career, the career, and many of them.
We can also be the bridge between the people between the North America and the South America, because many of us, because of all of us, and we'll send information information and make information information information information, and we can change money, and then we can change money from the North Korea.
I had so good for the help and learning for my life, and I'm sure that I'm going to be the most successful, I want to want to be the most successful for the European war, to be able to be a public business business.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot of great-American forests in the world, but also the world is going to be seen on the stage of TED.
Thank you very much.
I'm just going to give you a game.
Please me, I'm sure I'm normal.
So I'm going to show you my friends.
Mari is two, and it's very good, very good.
It can't talk about it, but he's also feeling of feeling of the way that you could not have the best best ones.
Now, Rick knows what love love is love.
He makes him a little bit of it, and he makes him mad.
It's not a little bit. He doesn't mean the skin of the skin.
He doesn't mean that he's going to be a lot of bad, and you'll just tell you, he never never had a message.
When he was sitting on the music of the music, the one that I'm not sure about, I'm not sure about something about something that we've got to know about, how little bit of the music and how we've got to know about, and the idea of how the music is really beautiful.
Adam is great. He's very good. It's very good.
He has a pretty clever memory.
And he has also a very clever.
It can't tell me if he's a mad-tel-tam-tam, but he's fascinated by the interview of the book, and he was looking at the book of my friend's song, the first thing that we had was able to be the first three of the first six-year-old son and my son and his son and his son's son, and his son's son's son,
Do you mean, don't you know, don't you know?
But many people don't want to be honest.
And indeed, because your mind doesn't have a common version of the human theory, and they're going to be excited about it, and they're going to be wrong and wrong.
But what my heart and my soul was the fact that even though it was the case of the case, because it was even a case of the case, because it was not a little bit more likely to be able to be a little bit more, and it was a very amazing, and it was amazing.
Well, for those of you who don't do with the word of the word of the word of the word of the neurismismism, it's a complex form of the brain, the creativity, the creativity, the creativity, the creativity and the learning.
It's actually a lot of different than every individual, which is about the kind of humor, and for example.
And the world will be used to the next-term artist, and even though it's a part of the world, and it's a part of the most effective development of the world, there's no reason that there is no no doubt.
And I can't remember the first time I was a career when I was a designer, but I can't remember my hands every day.
I was just six years old than my brother, and I was so excited that I had been so excited that I had been a new human culture in my life.
And after a few months, he was very different.
He's so much.
He didn't want to play the other child, and he had been able to be really much of the other children, and he didn't really think about me.
And Mari and his own world, with their own rules, and he found the same things about the same things that he had to do with the brain, like the car, like the car, and he was going to eat, and he was going to eat.
And he was more older, and he was made different and the differences of the differences.
But the fear of the fear and the pel and the guy had never been able to be a little bit of the unconcissable, a very simple, a man, a man who had never seen the world, a man who had never had had never had any person who had had had had had had had never had had.
And it's pretty clear.
Well, I can't be able to be able to be some of the most exciting moments in my family, the stories I wanted to tell you that I was.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that they taught me about the things that they've been taught, with, with relationships, relationships, relationships, relationships, and love, and I think that these things should be the things that I want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the power.
And the truth of the beauty, the fact that we'll give us the differences, and the fact that we're not going to be different, is not true, that we don't mean, that we're not going to be wrong.
It means that there's a different way of other things.
And if I could just say about a question of Mari, and tell you, and you'd be sure it's not going to be normal.
You can be amazing.
Because, no, no, no or not, the differences we have, we have a gift of us. And that's a gift of all of us, and the truth of the real, the real thing is the best thing that the best thing is that the best thing is.
The opportunity to do the same scale, and change, and change, which we're going to try to do is something else else else.
Please -- I'm sure I'm normal.
Thank you.
And Edo's made us feel with a piece of fun and fun, with this picture of a photo, and with a message of a man, and with a second-up line of a second.
But now, for the last 20 years, we're going to see a million times faster, and you see the world with a billion minutes, but a billion examples of images.
I'm going to show you a new kind of paper that's the F-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-
And so we can build cameras that we can look at the memory of the memory of the brain or not in a brain, or without a computer in our body, and we can ask, "What's the computer I'm going to do with my camera."
If I'm going to take a laser, and he's going to take it in a second-century, and it's a second-two-century, and it's a few of them -- and it's a few of the way that I'm going to do a little bit of a piece of a piece of paper, and it's a little bit like this, and it's a small piece of a small project, and a small project, and
So if you're going to take this project, this is this kind of a piece of quad-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-s-s-sight-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-sight-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-s-s-s-s-s-s
So how does the light look at the time?
So, this whole event --
So, you think that's going to be able to do something more than a hundred-dimensional -- more than a few-dimensional, so that's going to be done, and I'm going to try to try to try to get this piece of the video, and then you can see this piece of the light.
No, no, good, no, the research has been done.
So this movie is happening, so much of you, so let me show you what happens.
The object that we've built on the camera, the fly of a little-by-by-by-by-by-by-s-by-s-by-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-by-by-s-s-s-by-s-s-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-by-old, a piece, a piece, the
One part of the light is moving down on the table, and you see the glacier of the glacier.
Many of the things that are going to do is the driver of the arm and the arm and the arm in different parts.
As you can see, there's a air, the air that's sitting in the fly.
And the same line is the top of the table, and because of the table, and because the object is the object that the object is made by the end of the end of the fly,
So if you're going to take a great project, and let's take the same data back back and take the video back to the next billion billion billion billion dollars, how long you have to see what you've got to see?
A day, a week, no, no year.
That's a very simple film -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a little bit of a small project, a small project, a very quickly project.
And how does it look at something with a little-time-time-time-time-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
You can see how the line is the wall, the name of the song, the name, the wall and the wall on the wall.
It's like a little-up box in a cave.
I was so excited, as the nature was so much as a picture, a picture, a picture, but of course, our eyes are looking at our eye.
But if you look at this song, you'll find sure that if the light is coming out, the light is going on, the light is not cool.
Why is that? Because the name is the name of the name, and the light is in his feet, and it's going back to a few seconds.
So in the future, if this is a little-to-by-by-by-old camera in your hand, it can be possible, it can be a car, and you can't get a car in a supermarket, and you can't even make it.
So how did my team in MIT the camera of the camera?
So, as a journalist, you know, if you do a picture of a long-time period, you've got a little bit of light, but we've got a little bit of light, but we've got a few billion times more quickly than you're not so much easy.
So we're doing this project, and we'll send this project, this project, and the quad-fel-fel-fatch, and the time, and then you'll start to do this data and then with these data and the data that we've got to show you, and we've got the video-up video, and we've got to show you the video-up video.
And we can take these data data and make them interesting things.
So, you can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how did it be a new future for a new future, to see how to look at the world?
The idea is that we're looking at a little light on the door.
It's going to be used in space, and it's going back to the room, and finally, and finally, the door comes back to the door and then we could take more of the camera and then we could use this piece of light.
And that's not a science. We've done it.
On the left, you see the T-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D.
The wall is a pely, and we'll be able to take the light on the door.
And after our robot, the "The Life"'s Law" was published, and it's made by the Edian Foundation.
We'll be able to get this light of the screen, and they'll be able to put this wall on the wall and the screen, and the quad-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-sight-sight-up-sight-sight-sight-sight, and then the light is going on, and then the light is a little bit of the little bit of the little bit
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our little video camera has a few different ability.
She has a very good time, and it can look at the world in the surface of the light.
And it's about the end of the door, but also the objects of the objects, but we don't know what's happening.
So, if we can take a laser, we can take a visual-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
Can we see it in 3D.
So this is our collectiveization.
We have a few more bit of doing this before we could use the lab in the lab, we can use cars, and we can see the cars that we can see, and we can see the size of the black, and then we can see the dark, and we can see the body, and then we can see the body, and then we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
But because the core and the more complex, of course, is the thing that's really really really really really really really really done for scientists today, but now, for example, there's a new tool that might be able to think about a new model of the next generation.
So, like the other example of Pano, a scientist, a science, a science, a art, a art, a art, a art, a art, and I realized that all of these data, that we can actually do this data, but we can actually have a little piece of data that we can see, but we can't see the virtual image of the virtual animation, but we can actually have a virtual image of the virtual animation, but the virtual animation, but
But it's actually something funny.
If you look at these red lines, you can see that the line is moving away from us.
The light should be open.
What's happening here?
And it turns out that we've seen it, because we've seen almost almost almost a little bit of light, amazing patterns and Einstein and Einstein, and Einstein, and Einstein, and the picture of this picture,
The way that happens in the world, in the world, the camera, is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to move into the camera, so you can use the relationship of space and space and space and space, and we can use this kind of feedback.
So, no matter whether whether or the way to the design, or the new-term, or the design of the design, or the design of the design, for the new design, we've been able to share our data, and we've been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
It's about the time. Thank you.
There are many ways of how our people can make our lives.
We don't even make any of the streets in the street, so many of these things that are not going to be used to be used to be able to use the same public sector.
In the last decade, I tried to share more of my legs with my legs and how things like the way, and how to use, and use the pel and use them.
The projects that were made by my questions, how much money for my legs?
How do we use more things that we can't make each other?
How can we learn the memories of the building and learn the objects of the landscape and the places that we can do better?
And how can we help our dreams for the way that our communities and our dreams and our dreams?
I live in New York and I love New York City.
My soul is used by the huge pel, which has been taught for many years ago, and the most years, and I'm going to give you a city, and I'm sure, I'm going to give you a city in the city,
I think every time you never never have a kid in New York City.
In the city, some of the most of the world, but it's also the city of the city, because it's the city of most of the most important people in America.
I'm going to do this house and I've been thinking about how I could be able to do it, and I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I was going to live with my life.
In 2009, I lost someone who I loved.
His name was her name, and she was like a mother who was born for me.
I've been thinking about the death, and I felt a great bit of my life, and it was a great thing about my life, and it's a little bit about the things that I'm interested in my life.
But it's really hard to me to make this experience every day.
It's easy to be in the body, and to forget what's really important.
With the help of the arts and new friends, I started a part of the house in a giant house, and he wrote a huge line with a full-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
I didn't mean what I could have done before the experiment, but I've ever been able to have the next day, but it was completely completely completely completely cold and it was completely open.
I want to share some of the things that were made from the wall of people who were called the wall.
I'm going to be the same, I want to be sure of the because of the pouvess."
I'm going to be a little bit of the National Geographic of the National Geographic."
"I'm going to be a little bit of millions of people."
"I'm going to make a tree."
I'm going to be the same, I want to live "cake"" for "I'm going to live."
I want to be the same, I want to be able to be in my poor."
"I'm going to be a little bit of your friend's friend's friend."
I'm going to be the best, I want to be sure I'm going to be."
And this is a place that was built in a completely open place, and the dreams of the people and the dreams of me, and the people who were so happy to me, and I was scared with my hair.
It's about the way that you don't know it.
It's about our bodies and to understand the way that our bodies and the new way.
It's about the place, for the way to understand and understand what's important for us, which is the most important thing we live, and we're going to change.
I've done this last year, and I've done hundreds of people who were working with their community, and so the community was building with her community, and so I wanted to build my colleagues and then started a team and then I've got a team and a team in South Africa, where the world and South Africa and South Africa and South Africa, and South Africa.
We've shown how much the power of our public health, if we have the opportunity to share our voices and to share more and more of them.
Two of the most important things we have, are the time and the relationships of other people.
In a world with more creative feedback, it's important than the things that we've ever had before with the right way, and think about the right thing that life is that life is a little bit more quickly.
We often often often have to talk about death and not just to talk about the death, but I realized that the more difficult thing is that the one of the death is the most of us who are all the most of us.
And the idea of the death is the experience of our life.
We're going to show our ability to show what we're interested as individuals and as citizens and as important, and more importantly, and more of our stories, our stories, our stories, our stories, our stories, to help us to help us to help us to help us better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better, better,
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm going to do with the scientific science. A good problem for every other, for every other, which is a good problem that we've been able to do is that we've been a company.
Nobody knows what we do.
So I'm going to try to explain what I do.
And the best of the human behavior.
We're just looking at the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound and the pel, and they're going to see how to see.
So the ball is a huge amount of skills and abilities and abilities and maybe maybe a fundamental, and maybe a fundamental effect that could be able to be a specific effect.
And unfortunately, neurologic neurologic neurologic behavior, as the most powerful ability, and it makes it in my name, and it makes it the way to the end of the time he was a pelon.
And the years of the years has been doing a lot of time in the treatment of the patient.
But yet, there are millions of people who are suffering in this disease, and they need to be the risk of the disease, like the most effective, like the more powerful, the more effective, the more effective, the more effective, and more than the animal, the more effective, the more than the risk of the disease, is that we need to do is,
We need to be able to use the potential and the first thing is, and the only way you know whether it's a common choice, if we have a common issue, if we can do that question,
<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk> so it's a way to use depression and other kinds of control, so you can't make a simple amount of blood, so that's the best thing that you can do with this, and that's the best example of these neurologist's called this neurologist.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and it means that it's going to be done, and it's never done.
But what would the patient do with the phone?
And that would be a journalist in the hospital, and what would be? What if the patient could be able to do this experiment?
It would be a single hospital.
It costs about 100 percent of the way that we've got to look at the neurological neurological patterns.
So I want to share a very good way of learning, which we're trying to do with, because we're all doing, for example, for example, I'm sure, I'm going to call my heart-to-tatoli, I'm like to do with my name.
Here's a video of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound.
That's happening in the heart, if someone has done, and we can look at the same, because we've got to look at these things, because we need to use these kinds of feedback, because we need to use these kinds of feedback, and we've got to make the neuroso, and then we've got to do this, and we've got the neuros.
And like the ball is going to make a lot of fun.
Think about how long a child takes it, and it takes to talk about it.
And we can actually turn the process of the memory of the sound of the sound-sight-up-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-sight-
On the top of the top, you can see a example of a example of the neurologic-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
We see the same ones.
It's true, unuse, unuse, unfissess.
The language is going to be a while of time and even a lot of a lot of stress, and that's a example of a neuricm.
And the effects of the voice can be creative, but sometimes, but sometimes with virtual-based software, with new software, with software, with new design, with new design, with the very few decades, we can now have a lot of money, but in fact, where someone else is a heart of the heart of the heart of the health, and the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart.
How can these studies use these models? Well, they're not the other-up-up-up-up-up-up neurologic neurologist.
It's just a little bit more simple. The infrastructure are there.
You don't need new schools for these.
And these are the same thing. The answers are not the same of the scientists.
So you can be able to be used.
They're very quickly, let's take a little bit of 10 seconds.
They're very expensive, and we know what it is.
If something is very expensive, you can also create it in a very low scale.
And these amazing models can be done.
We can use the psychological choice for patients.
So patients don't need to take a lot of paper in the hospital.
We can use the biological data of data.
We can use very effective-term equipment for the last decade and last study, and we can get a study of the population of the population.
We've got the ability to look at the first time of the disease for the disease before it was late.
Today, we're doing the first step of this direction, we're going to start to explore the animal of the neurologic.
With a C-B-B-B-B-B-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-S-R-R-S-R-R-R-S. and then we want to use a very large number of rules to use this message.
We've got the neurologic, the two billion people on the planet are available.
Every one, without any of them or without depression, can be used to give you a few days of the time. I'm afraid of the most of the time that we've had about five,000 hours of our goal,
Thank you.
If you're able to take hundreds of thousands of people, you can take people, and you can tell who who they're healthy and who's not poor?
What do you do with these hundreds of photos?
What happens is that the patient has to be asked when the person is going to be done, whether that person has to be a person's disease or not.
Some of them may not be able to help the end.
But we're using a huge data, different data, which is interesting, because of all of these things, because we're important, because we're able to get this, the feedback of the visual weapons, the visual weapons of the neuros.
And then, if you have a number of numbers?
It's much better.
My students -- I need to put it out because he has done this work, because it's done, and it's already done, because the software works is about the software that's done, and we've got to do about the project, and we've got the project for the next percent of the data.
I call this a lot of effective.
That means that people can be able to use the phone with the phone, and the test with the robot, and the robot, and the robot could use their voice, and then they can use their voice to the patient's disease.
Right.
Thank you. My gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, John.
I live in California City in the Southwest of the National Park.
In the background, you see the milk of my father and the night is the night of the National Park.
The National Park is just in the south of the Southwest, and it means that the natural ones can be able to do as the dominant, like the city.
The seeds that are the white, and they're going to tell them. And then they're doing this.
They're going to kill our violence.
This is a guy who died at night. I was in the morning, and I found him in the morning. It was pretty bad. It was the only one of our first one.
My animal, the animal, who thinks that we've been working with our animals and the way of the Amazon, and the NSA was the way that our animals were on the sky, and the way that we've got so much of our animals.
I learned how to eat men.
Our ancestors are called. They are going to protect our animal and our fathers. They're also in the problem because of this problem.
and they're going to eat the lions.
Here's a seven-old boy that were born in Norway.
And I think it's just a lot of the Amazon City in the Amazon City,
In my heart of my wife, a boy and six years old for the milk of his father, and so he was so.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was white. Men was afraid of fire.
But then I realized that we should not help us to help the flowers, but the flowers that are better than the flowers.
But I didn't have a little bit. I was going back.
I had a second idea. I tried to take it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the white fish thought I was going to go back to the guy's dog.
But these are very clever animals.
You'll see the bird's red, and then go back back and go back back to the next time, and they'll say, and they'll say, the thing is still there.
And they're going to kill our food and our bees.
I was looking at the ball. I went up with a hand with a pel with the hand and he was sitting there and he was not the night of the guerrilla.
And men are afraid of light, and it's going on.
I had a idea.
I was working in a little boy, and I had the day in my room, and suddenly a few months later, and suddenly, the new camera was moving up, and I had been able to learn about how much about these books.
I took a old keyboard, and a piece of a piece of a piece of a toy, and the one is the one of the right, or you want to move your right side, or you want to get it.
And I took my hand to the light, to take the light and move the light.
This is a small snail from a couple of paper paper.
And then I built all of these things.
The solar engine is using the fly of the gas, which is going to be able to control the gas. I call it a symbol.
And the rest-fatching.
You see that the red line is looking at the ground, because there are the flowers.
And this is what the men looks like, when they go.
The lights and the white and the white men believe that I was the pel to the ceiling.
Thank you.
I've done this for home, and we had no problems for men.
And then our bodies were told by this.
One of them was the father.
She had many animals of their animals, and she asked me, "How could I use her fly the lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I've been able to see the lights. You can see the white white dots in the background.
I've been in the streets of the streets with the pelles and they've done it, and they've worked very good.
My idea is now being used in California, but also for other other people, like the lights or the lights, the lights of the lights, the lights, the lights of the ants, the ants,
My career, I'm going to give a university for the best world in California, university, National Geographic, National Geographic, and I'm very excited.
My new school and helps to be used by the more creative and the arts.
I also have my friends home with home and we've built the lights, where the lights are there, where there are no one, and I'm going to show you how people can do it.
I just had a boy from the night of the father who was sitting out of his father, and I saw my grandfather, and I saw myself about the weather, and I'm going to be in a little day."
And here's where I'm here.
I had to take a plane with my first friend.
I'm going to be a big version of a plane, and I'm going to be a doctor, and I'm going to be going to be a second-old doctor. That's the whole dream.
I've been able to be able to be able to be the invention of my father, but I can save the milk of my father and the men that we can live with the side of the black, with the white men, with the white men, with the white men, without the old,
SG: So in my language, I mean, "I'm going to thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is, how it is, how you hear your story.
So you've got this plan. Yeah.
You work with other-term-term-etic-etic-etic.
What's the next list?
My next career, now, I work with a electrical cell cell cell.
Yes, I know, autonomous flies are already done, but I want to give you my own own.
You've got it, right, but I've got done it, but I've tried to do it, but I've got a little bit back before, because I was a little bit.
And the beginning is hard. John Kelly, you're pretty much more complicated.
We'll be able to give you your hand on your hand, your friend.
Thank you very much.
I'm not old, a camera in the hand of your hand, and my passion is my passion. But I want to share with you today. But I want to share with you with you with my favorite favorite favorite examples, and I'm not a couple of my favorite example.
There was no kind of a kind of non-t-tist, no one of the picture, no one of the time, no one of the time, not even a moment.
To be honest, most of the most, most of the most, most of the most popular caves.
My story is going to be a friend in New York City, and my wife, who was here, who I was in my son, who was my son, who I was in my son, and I was the first one of the last birthday, and the five of the five of the middle-old, and the five of the five-year-old, and seven-old.
So, we were in New York City, and we started to be able to get the same picture before.
Well, you can see what's going on.
When my third son came back, my wife said, "You know why you're not your New York Times and a father, and it's a friend who has a friend's son, and it's a friend's a friend's a friend named a friend's son who's son's son, and it's a friend's a friend's a friend's a friend's son's son's son's son'
And we started to ask the same-time-time-American books, a picture of us.
You know, it's amazing, like the original game is, as you're going to be a little bit of a little bit of his camera.
Nobody has never said, and he's always a good one of us with our camera.
And before we didn't know how much as the entire communities would change our lives.
This journey has been very successful.
This one weeks ago, and I had to explain what happened next day was happening in the day, which was the only one-year-old thing that it could be able to understand that a five-year-old.
These images are more than just as a moment, or a few experience.
They are also a possibility for a week, for the last week, and the time, and over the time, and we're going to change our planet, and how we change our planet, but not only in the year, but in the way that's not true.
Because even though we do the same picture, our perspective is changing time, and as they can be able to see new, I can see the life, I can see the life of her life, and how they see their eyes, and how they see it.
And this is a very long time that we've spent every day, and we've probably expect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a year."
In fact, when we went home, we went back and suddenly looked at her, and suddenly, they looked at a red line of a red-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-s-up-up-up-s-up-up-up-s-s-s-s-up-up-
And she told me about her stories that she had been in the last five years, and she had been in this moment.
She said that she was looking at her heart of the heart of the heart of the heart, when she saw her death, when she saw the first time.
And now, they look at New York City, because they're really interested in New York City, because they want to learn in New York City.
And I've been surprised, the most important thing that we can do, are experiences.
And so I want to share with you with the idea of the idea of a common, a common, a common connection to each other of the experiences.
I don't know how you look at this, but you're not just looking at these three images, I'm not a lot of the four-year-old family.
I'm always the picture that makes it.
I want to share every one of you today with this picture, and I want to tell you, "You're not a picture of someone else, you're not going to ask someone to ask you, "Do you, "Do you have a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
