When I was 11 years old, I was a morning of the sounds of the sounds of the shock.
My father was listening to his little little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy from what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was very late at the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone away!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father clearly very happy.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
I'm never forget this morning.
I mean, a real school.
The Taliban was pushing the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned girls to go to school.
So I was able to get my five years old and my older sister who had not been able to go back alone to be a secret school.
And we could go to school.
Every day we took another way to do that nobody could predict where we went.
We're hidden our books in the car store so it looks like we'd just go.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a nice, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were paying our life-related: teachers, students and our parents.
And then, the class had to go back to the class for a week, because the Taliban had to be fired.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be in?
Did you know where we live?
We were scared, but we also wanted to go to school.
I had a lot of lucky fortune in a family where education was more important and identified by daughters.
My grandfather had a long chance to predict.
A foreign-downed from a remote farm in Afghanistan, and he was his daughter, my mother -- to send school, and became rejected by his father.
My mother was born in my own mother,
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the late, just to move our house to school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here, the first one -- was the first one in his family who ever received a school.
And it was always clear that his children would get a education education, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much greater risk to send his children to school.
I still know that I was so frustrated in the Taliban in the last years, and I was so frustrated by our life, from the complete fear and the perspective of view.
I was so lucky to give up, but my father said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can get paid money. You can be transported from your house from your house.
But one thing that you're always going to stay in is what's here. And even if we're going to pay our blood to your home, we're going to have to pay it.
So you want to give yourself more."
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age, I have a higher degree of an international degree as a professor. And if my family didn't have been so much as much as a lot of my education, I would also have one of these women.
Instead, I'm standing here as a sad-time Jewish Jewish of the Grand College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather who was beaten up from his family because he was forced to send his daughters to school, one of the first who was given me.
He's not just about my graduate school, but also because I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman who runs him through the car through Kabul.
My family thinks to me.
I have great dreams, but my family has more greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for women's education.
So I helped to start to build MOLA, the first one, and maybe the only medical bank for girls in Afghanistan, a country in school, in the school of girls who are still still less risky.
It's wonderful to see how the students in my school with a great master for all their individual opportunities.
And see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents, despite the opposite and the rest of all the events.
As a result, like Ahmed. This is not really his name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is one of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he went back to the home of San Francisco in her village, and they are out of the death of a bomb on the street for a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone is running, and he's wearing a voice gun, and he'd let him go back to school, and he would try it again.
He said, "Tear me now, if you want to be, but I'm not going to put the future my daughter on the game because of your old-time and pre-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex
What I've discovered in Afghanistan, so I've been able to realize something that is often going to be rejected in the West: the most of us who have success, is a father who sees the value of his daughter and recognize that it's also success.
It shouldn't be called that our mothers are not really passionate about the role in our success.
In fact, they're often often the ones who are very focused on and more and more optimistic for their daughters's future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men are not responsible.
The Taliban went out to school for a few hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred times, because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million million girls are in the school bank.
Afghanistan is looking at America, so different.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not longer from the long-term and with the U.S. military groups are changing everything.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I look at the students in school, and their parents who are using them for them to help them, I see a very promising future and a long-term change.
For me, a country of hope and the unconcessable opportunities, and remember me every day the girl who go to the TEDx.
As I have big dreams.
Thank you.
I do everything I've been doing, including my life -- I've been inspired by seven years in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977, I see young, but I'm young, but I'm not -- I have -- I have in Zambia, Kenya, Kenya, Bolivia and Somalia, working with the technical projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian MOOOO and every single project that we had on the legs, failed.
I was absolutely scared.
I thought I've been born in Italy, I think that we're a lot of good people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we knew everything we were doing.
Our first project, which was my first book called Lick Lam<unk> in Zam<unk>amp; was one of the people we wanted to show in Italy as a lot of food.
We came up with Italian seed in South America, in this order to put this out of Sami's Hospital. We were learning to support the local population of the Asian and the Thowini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely absolutely absolutely not interested in it, so we were paying them to work, and sometimes they were coming on.
We were amazed that there was no such a mass of dry agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "God, thank you that we're here!"
And anyway, if you're going to save the people from Sajas Paulo to save the mammoth."
Of course, everything's wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-great-pilled tomato sauce. In Italy, they were so big, in Sambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, like not just agriculture."
When the slime and red were red, about 200 obs from the river, and all the way.
And we said to the Torana, "Oh God, the Normy!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why did you say this?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great in Italy in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French World War did, and then I saw what they did, and then I saw what they've done, I was pretty proudly proud to our project in Zambia.
We were at least the Normy.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the stupidness we didn't have to have any of the non-human people.
You should read the book "Michadad Aid Aad at Cisa Moyo, and it's a super-terrorist scientist.
The book was published in 2009,
We've given the African continent a trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money had done.
Just to read her book.
Think about a African-inin, which we've been doing.
We are Western people who are Arabians, colonialists, missionists, and there are only two species in the way we deal with people. We're called the informal, or we're a patriological.
And they're the words from the Latin Asian root, which means "Sid" is called "Sid."
But they have two different meanings.
Conbiological: I'm also a different culture of every other culture than they were my children. I love you so much."
Patcous: I'm also self-to-a-a-half culture as they were my grandfater.
So the white people in Africa are called "woody," the boss,
I was shocked when I read the book "mall" "mally" from the vissy," and he said, especially in the economic development, if people don't want to go back and stay in the end.
So this should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of help is respect.
And this conference morning, who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocococic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I decided to use a system called a company called a company called a company where never is going to be re-t been taught, but you're going to be taught someone who's been forced to be the local community, the local community, who have a better person.
What you do -- you're going to keep the mouth.
You've never reached a community with ideas, you're going to be involved with the local community.
We don't work from office.
We're in cafeteria. We're going to meet in K-mell-Bell.
We have no infrastructure.
We're looking at friends and finding out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give someone a idea.
If this person doesn't like to do what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own life is the most important thing of humanity.
We're helping to find knowledge because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea, maybe the knowledge, but it's available.
I had this case for many years, and why was it a case to come out in a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in the community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community-suppers.
You never have to speak in the public public, and they'll never say what they want to do with their money, which is what they want to see for opportunities.
So planning has this glump.
The most best people in the community don't know because they never seem to be seen in public meetings.
We work to do one to do this, and we have to do this, a social infrastructure that has to be made, which has not existed.
A new job has to be created.
This is the house of the company who's a hospital who's in the house with you in your kitchen, in your kitchen room, and in the cafe, helps you to find your passion to change your life.
I've been doing this in the vicist, West West II, trying to do it.
I was also talking about time, and I tried to keep the cold-taty, where we say other things to do,
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and in the first three days, I helped him, and I helped him a fish in a garage, he was Maii. I helped him to sell him to a restaurant, and then the fishermen came to jail, and they said, "You've helped us.
I spent these five fish, working together, and this wonderful tuna didn't sell in a factory in Albany for 60 cents to 40 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars to the U.K.K. and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you've helped them. Can help us help us help us help us help them.
I had been walking 27 projects a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I'm listening to her mouth and listen to them."
So -- so -- the government says, "Let's take it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helped 40 companies in the beginning of the building.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business worker of history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was working with companies. Peter Hillis said, "Cake is actually unregless with a professional society and the economy."
So planning is the death of the entrepreneurs's mind.
So you're building Christel, and you can't know what the most popular man's favorite Christy is trying to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this to get a place.
You have to offer them a discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to be re-sexed.
In a community of 10,000,000 people, we've got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people who have the intelligence and passion?
What's the talk that you've been doing today for most of you today?
<unk>Audess, passionate people. This is what you've been doing.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to do.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the un-re-table fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The motor engine is not sustainable.
The quality of the state is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion billion people in sustainable ways, cure, build, build, build, and use them with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who is this technology for the green revolution? universities? Remember!
government? Remember!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a pre-religious magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who invited to go to the future of New York City in 18 to 185.
In 180, they came together and they were looking at what would happen in the city of New York City for a century. The conclusion was an unknown: the city of New York City would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve and said, if the population grows on the speed, they needed six million horses to be transported to people, and it would be impossible to get the crap with six million dollars.
Because they went down in the crap.
They're seeing the dirty technology that's going to be in New York City.
What happened? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 100 dollars in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, the race had made. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
Eddd, Michigan. Henry Ford Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered by the discourse.
They don't get to them. They're not talking to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, talented and passionate services.
You have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
And the smallest to the biggest company, all of them have to be able to do three things: to sell the product to be great, the market market needs to be great and the financial literature.
Do you think about it?
We've never met a single person who's using something at the same time, sell and sell it to the money.
That's not something that exists.
This person had never been born.
We've been working on research, and we've been looking at the 100 inatic companies in the world -- Carnegie Wurtham, the first one, the new companies, Google, YouTube.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one: no one was founded by one person.
Now, we teach 13-old entrepreneurs in North Carolina, and we start to give them the class to the first two sides from Richard Bransica, and the task is the last 13-year-old side of the age of Richard Cica, which is how often he uses the word "mood" and the word "wood."
Never always "w" and 32 times a time.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. No one.
So we can create a community in the lead to the Anctor who's wearing a small professional community in cafeteria and the man's family, and your loved sister who are doing what someone who's done for this gentleman, who talks about someone who's talking about you. What you need to do?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do this." "You'll be thinking I'm going to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting the company of leadership to help them find the skills and people, and we found that the idea of the health of the local population, that the culture and the economy can change the creation of the content and their imagination.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago how to be to be Alice in the miracles of the country.
Penn State University asked me -- a professor, a professor for communication -- to address engineers in communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid. These students were talking to their big brains with their big brains and their great books and their big words, not to be religious.
But as the conversation developed, it turned out to me like Alice, when she was walking down the way down to the mammoth, and a door to a new world.
I felt like I was working with the students with the students. I was amazed about the idea that they had, and I wanted to find that other wonder of this miracle country.
I think to open the door, it requires great communication.
We need to really have great communication from our science scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are the biggest problems, like the most important problems, the environment, the environment, the environment, and the health, and we don't know about it, and then it's not going to go forward. I think it's not about our responsibility as a scientist.
But these amazing conversations are not happening when our scientists and engineers are not invited to come to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please sit up.
I want to show you some ways to do it, as you can do it, we can see that science and technology that you're busy with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to is, is, yeah?
Let's tell you why your scientific field is so relevant to us.
Not only remind us that your garage-taughter is looking at her, but also tell us that their clothes, the gloves, the light structure in our bones, because it's important to treat and to treat the immortal.
And when you describe what you do, then you're not going to be fired.
Now, in the same term, a barrier to understanding your mind.
I'm sure you could use it as a new and time-time, but why not just don't tell you space and time, which is much more comfortable for us?
We're going to be able to make our idea of understanding, not the same thing you're going to get from the level of the standard.
As Einstein said, "Make things like this as possible as possible -- but not easier."
We can tell you something about your scientific field without having to deal with the trade.
So some things are to think about it is that examples, stories and analogies. In this way, you can turn us into your hand.
And if you're looking at your work, then you'll take the dots away.
Have you ever wondered why it's called the point?
What happens when someone else is going to be? Another other one is just a little bit of hours, and with those first dots, your audience.
This is not just a slide like this, but it's also boring, but it's also also also also a lot of the work that we've been talking about our brain, and that's how fast we're focused on.
This example of Gene Clby Brown is a lot more powerful. It shows that the special structure of the body of the body is so stable that even the inspiration for the original design of the Eiffel.
The trick here is to use a single individual to use the eye-through sentence that's going to lose the audience when it's going to lose the plate, and then you can use images and images that are also changing our senses and then to understand what it's called.
And this is just a few ways that can help us open the door and see the wonder country that is going to be involved in technology.
And the engineers that I've taught, I've been taught to connect with the <unk>Nueen in my eye in a narrow-up, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
So, you look at your science data and you're looking at your research, and you're going to be looking through the vic, so the audience says what's important, and you've got the whole passion to your work, and you've got this incredible work, and you've got the ability to look at it, and you've got more different things that are full-term experiences.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can use a crime in the human region in Syria.
You can put a message in a cell phone and start a post-out in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get a little bit at the soundboard and be famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm living in Berlin a year in 1996, and I'm living in Berlin.
Let's go back to the time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and found them.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we've looked at all these people who had gone from and the changes that had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Keep it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep it up.
Be it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
It's a lot. Almost every one has a cell phone today.
But today, today, my cell phone and my cell phone talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35-6 lines of data.
Data.
And why are this information there?
In the summer of the E.R.R.R. is a legal line.
Now, the right-up is called the law-telf trade chain.
Now, the right line is that every phone company in Europe, every phone company in Europe, every Internet service in the entire country has to store a range of EVOV.
Who calls who? Who is going to send a email?
Who is a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
And this information is going to be done for the same information for about six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet car.
And everywhere, people were up there and said, "We don't want to be."
They said, we don't want to be able to be rid of these stock-tatial transport.
We want to self-term self-dimensionality, and we don't want to want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to."
And here, as many thousands of people on the streets of Berlin, they said, "Fatess instead of fear."
And some people said that this could be on the Lye.
The Lye was the Lobopopianii in easternlandland.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can all this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the fifth-communications, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, I asked you to put all the information that you've been raped me.
And I asked her, and she said, she got back and she didn't get the right answer. Only even a half-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's going to be on with the backside.
So I decided to put a court process on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Second Tele-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D
And then it came to the end of the end of them.
I'm going to take the back to the back-up, which they're all going to send me information.
In the meantime, the state of the state, the introduction of the E.R. was right at the German law.
So I got this white brown tap with a CD.
And on the CD, this was this.
35-fours.4 lines of information.
And I first saw it and said, well, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But then I realized that's my life.
This is six months of my life in this stage.
So I was a little bit skeptical about what I'm going to start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm sleeping at night, which I do.
And then I said, I want to go to this information on public.
I want to do it.
Because I want to show people what's called the Defense Council.
So, with online and open data, I did this.
This is an animation of six months of my life.
You can zoom down and zoom out and zoom down, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step I do, and then take it back.
And you can even see how I'm going to go from Frankurturtham to the train oil, and how many calls I do.
This is possible by the information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking a few times together.
And then I call some friends and they call them each other.
And after a while you call you up and you call it up, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central characters, like the leader are the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building program for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design design, as you can monitor a society, because you know who talks to who's talking to a email, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is taken for least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I first said, we've been looking at all these people in the streets of the U.K. phones in 1989, in her pocket.
And the guy who knew who was at the demonstration, and if the Stah was there, who had been the leader, then it would never have happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall wall, the case, you couldn't have happened.
And then, the case of the Arctic Rockwell.
Because today, national agencies and companies want to store all the information that they can be able to get over us, online and forth.
You want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store all the time.
But even self-excession and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-esteem today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you're going to say your friends, privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
When you go home, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to say, you're going to have companies, but companies, you have a certain information to store, and you don't have to store any information, they've got to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone phone company to the information that you've been carrying over.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-termity in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the most-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through-through spaces.
So the city program is coming and thought that the name of South Central Central, so it's something different to do, it changed it in South Los Angeles, and it changed it as if something changes in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Sorting fruit stores, rapid-speed restaurants, air spaces.
Like 22, 25, millions of Americans, I live in the food city of Central Central Central Los Angeles, the home of Dr.S. and the F.S.
The comry is that the Dr.D. is more likely to kill more people than the Filysys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the un-fable diseases.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than in Osly in the Oster Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't get that anymore.
And I wondered how you felt, if you had no access to healthy food, if you go out of the house, the negative effects that you see in your neighborhood, the food system has your neighborhood.
I've been able to buy the Roll-shoo-t-too-t-too-t-touch and sold like the way the fly.
I see a conversation-up spaces like Starbucks.
And I realized that this has to stop.
I thought that the problem is the solution.
It's food and food, the solution is the solution.
And I didn't like to have a little bit more fun at the 18-minute, to get a apple that's not under the same.
So I used a food bomb before my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park.
It's 45 feet in three feet.
That's the thing that it's heard of the city.
But you have to care about it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility and I have to hold it."
And I decided to keep it in the state.
So I came and my group, the L.A. and Green Dugs, and we started to plant my food, and plant the fruit, and fruit, so the whole program, the food, vegetables.
We're a kind of professional group, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together, together from all social layers and from the city, it's completely free, and everything we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone else goes on.
And the city came up to me, and he was basically a constant land, and he said that I had to go out and say I had to get my garden to be a vaster.
And I thought, "Well, yeah, right?
And the idea of how to deal with growing food from a piece of land that you're absolutely not alive?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because it wouldn't be on the other time.
LAA. Times got wind. Steve Liozzz, and I talked about a story about the city and talking to a member of Green Washington. And they did a petition on the R.org.org, and we were successful.
We thought about the war in the hands.
My town actually called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, why shouldn't they do that?
LA.A. has the most of the rests of the city in the city.
They have a hundred miles in the palm of the palm.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough space to plant 725 million cancers in plants.
Why should they not find that OK?
So as you get a plant, you'll get 1,000 thousand thousand, 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get a dollar of a dollar, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my assistant, I'm going to tell people that they should be building their own food.
Their own food is like to print their own money.
Look, I have a legacy in South Central Central Central.
I grew up there. I've been raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this pre-dived reality that was made by other people, and I'm my own reality.
See, I'm an artist.
Working is my graffiti. I'm going to put my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's running the walls, I'm going to be able to keep the outside of the sky and the air.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my most of my work for this stuff.
You'd be surprised what the Earth is doing everything, if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sun-like sun is, and how they hide people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
So to change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You would be wondering how kids are influenced by it.
In the middle of the psychic and the most powerful act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You'll get more than more than the other time.
I remember this time, as this mother came to her daughter and her daughter, it was about 10 om. She was about 10 o in my backyard, and I came out and looked at her.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the same reason to the street."
I was embarrassed when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just made me feel more vulnerable to do this. People asked me, "You don't have fear your food."
And I said, "Wormus, no, no, I'm not afraid that she's going to be.
It's also on the street.
So this is the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take their health back."
I put a garden in this homeless room in Oakland.A.
These are the guys who helped me to put the wheel.
It was cool and they shared their stories about how it influenced her and how she's raised her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it changed for a moment.
And the other thing that's happening to be that it's like 20 different spaces that have been built.
So we started to get rid of our vystes, so 50 people came up with them and we did all the volunteers.
When you grow up, children eat carbon dioxide.
When they grow, they eat hygiene.
But if they're not allowed to get out if they're not shown how food and body lives are blind, they're always eating whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see these white children who are right at the path they're looking at, and they're not going to go on.
I see the rests as a chance to train these children to care about their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could take the next George Washington Carel.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we're never going to do it.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do.
I want to use a whole area of spaces in California, where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take a ship to the board of the board, and then turn it into healthy cafe.
So, you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free-too, because free is not sustainable.
The comry of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking to people who are working for work and children from the streets, and they are enjoying the joy and the honor to learn when you're building their own food, and if you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to do this sexy.
I want to say that we're going to become all the ecological tran, the gang, the gang-touch.
We have to turn the picture of the cliffs.
If you're not a vater, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a little bit like a napie, yeah?
And let's take the gun to your choice.
When you want to meet me, you don't call me in the fryy, and you want a meeting where you're talking to anyone else.
When you want to meet me, you come with your skirts, in my backyard, so we can plant some of them.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm one of my favorite words in the morning English dictionary is "nyny-ty-old."
It sounds so nice.
And "Deary Prolly" means "nessless politicians."
Now, despite the 19th century a newspaper interview, a better definition of a child called "A Mondydydy, someone who is a head-talking, independent program, or a program, and his success, and success through the most-streated power.
I have no idea what was the paper-tat.
And I think about somebody else with words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
In 1771, for example, the British parliament had been reported to be the same word of the debated.
And that was actually back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brill Cillbyby, who was on the parliament.
They put him in the Eiffel of London and we put him up a little bit, but he was so strong enough to go to the head, and finally he had so much support in London.
And just a few years later, we've found the first score for the sentence "The Bill." Many believe.
Lumping on the English word for the same word.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a foreign officer's press.
But to show you how words are open and politics are designed, I want to take you with the United States at the time they've reached independence.
And you saw the question of how to call George Washington Washington, the state of the state,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a universal nation?
It was based on Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of possible-touch-up samples.
I wanted to call him some people Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the rest of the people of America.
It's not such a little bit like this.
Some people wanted to call him the king.
They thought it's going to be.
They were not monocology, they wanted to choose the king for a certain time.
It could have worked.
But every one was a little bit more bored because this debate was three weeks ago.
I've read the book at the days of a list that's always writing, "I'm not going to write the same topic."
The reason for the time, and the long-term was the archive of the Mall was on the Abat.
The archive of the Olympic House didn't want to be the Washington Washington Dier. They didn't want to.
And the king, and it might be able to give it to ideas to his end.
They wanted to give him the most slow, most, most lonely title that they were looking at.
This is the title of the title.
President. They didn't invented the title. He had existed before. But he also meant that someone was out of a post of a meeting.
It's like a pre-dight attack.
He had no size than the term "wear" or "wug."
Sometimes there were smaller president-fated workers and government groups, but it was really a unconcessible title.
So, the end of the Senate, he was on his head.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to stop the prison license.
Who is going to take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like President the United States of America?"
And then, after three weeks of debate, the U.S. has not been on.
Instead, you don't want to think about the title "The Searget Story" but they wanted to be absolutely clear because they were not aware of their honest respect for the constraints and civil nations, whether it's a monarchy, whether it's the state of the state of the state, and the United States's not the most respected, and the World War's opinion of the World War, it's not the other.
You can learn three interesting things.
First of all, and this is what I think I'm the best -- until I have no idea if the Abmer was ever given the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, he's just the title of a beloved. He's waiting to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something very rapid -- you're waiting to wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States of America today doesn't sound so hard, right?
and that has a little bit more than 5,000-fowers of the brain that he has, and the biggest economy of the world and a podric drone and all this stuff.
and history has given the size.
And so the end of that is the end.
They have a respect title.
And the other concern of the jury, the head of the celess of self -- now it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear wars and so on.
So finally, the Abat, and the archive of the house lost, because nobody feels a bit more scary when you said, you're now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away, and I'll give you a little bit.
Politics are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality more and more words than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came up in a car with about 50-way rail-tight rail, and a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a 15-year-old, a-old-old-old, from Jacksonville.
I'm a black-through-through-through-through-through-through-taughter and a rocket in the direction that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I was already born with the war, but at the time, at the time, at the time, at the time, with the Thama and football TV, and the hard-dhrough-through South African-Saharan African-Americans and the pre-dated conflict, and the homeless community, and the idea that I knew before I knew what was going on.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, a man-in-American, South African-Amerystard from God's Sabbath, and a radical cultural artist who lived in Afghanistan, and has been working on the last nine years.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan, but I don't like to paint the art. I want to paint art-like art, and to make the personality and to be re-intled and re-exited and re-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex
I want to spend a day in life of a jihad -- which is called the terrorist Society, like "Bop-like" and armed with religious corruption to keep.
And otherwise, what can do with the jihad's job as the parliament and a choice campaign with the slogan: "Make me," I do a lot rich."
And trying to use this campaign to let these Marim-S-S-Soyi who spend their national heroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rove," where you're going to be a secret control on the streets of Kabul and to go back to the streets of Kabul instead of taking money, and to pay money, and in February, they hope that they hope that they're going to be in Afghanistan.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has been developed in the era of the World War.
The war and the stranger who came up with him, have created a new environment for St.C. and fashion, which you can only capture in the way to capture a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers that I've been able to be able to be a local, or a lot of a living-towned, or a multi-tid-touch-touch-touch-telf.
And I would like to see how a simple pock between Kabul in 18 to the Soscow of 18 to create a dialogue about this today, today, the origins of the European Rightsian protests of the man, to have a beautiful man to protect it and even a little bit more and even a little bit more civil.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misunderstood, they can be misnined.
But I do it because I have to do because the geography of self-esteem has to be.
This is my pay. What is your wife?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Josh Cooper Cooper, and for a while, I work as a model.
For about 10 years, right now, they said.
I feel like this is a feeling that now in the room, there's a unfinished tension, because I didn't have to wear this dress.
I've got to turn another on the other side.
So this is the first time that someone in the TED stage is now about, so you can be happy to see this, I think.
Now, if some women were really brave when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I read at Twitter.
I'm also sure that I'm a very privileged thing, because I can change in very short 10 seconds, which I think you're thinking about.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
These are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to carry it at all.
The most difficult part is to move the breath over my head, because you'll be all the time you're all going to be out, so you're not doing anything, as long as he's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not so uncomfortable as this picture.
It's a picture of a visual, but it's also a picture of the most basic.
I've just changed your view in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never had a friend's friend.
I felt very uncomfortable and the photographer told me I was going to put my back-tight oil and with my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides the long-term surgery or the wrong thing that I've been looking for two days ago, there are very few ways to change our own fears and our fears, even though it's a big impact in our life.
It's not too true to be honest to me today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but I'm also the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you get a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic pandemic and a very important legacy and maybe ask you what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only been defined beauty as healthy and young and primitive, which is designed to be designed by the wisdom of the process of creation, but also as big, lonely, and bright.
And this legacy became designed to me. And it's a legacy that's been taken me out for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionists call "Hally, Marley, and Guan. Loo.<unk>B.<unk>B.<unk>B.<unk>B.<unk>B.
And at first, I'm talking to your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, in the year, a very successful doctor at the University of the Times, all the modifors on the course, each single one who was being executed, and that Jeff7 can be less than four percent.
The next question that always always asks me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown?"
And I finally say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give these little girl is, why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can be the president of the United States or the founder of the Internet or a Ninthai-win-win prosthetic, which would be absolutely wrong, because you were the first."
And when they say about this amazing scale, "No, no, no, no, Toyota, I want to say a model," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing, and you could be the boss of the American bird or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Me.
And you want to say that you want to be a model later, it's like you'd say, you'd want to get the Jack B.R.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a second-term model of model, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be left.
If there's a photographer and the light there, and the light is right there, like a nice sheet, and the driver says, "Con, we want to go back in the room," and then the leg goes up, and then you go back to the back, and you're going to move back, and you're going to look back, and you're going to see, 300, and you're going back, and you're going back, and
It looks like this.
I think it's less weird than this in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened.
When you're going to go to school and you've done a life and a few jobs, and you can't say a lot more, and if you say, President of America wants to be the U.S.S., but in your life, you're looking at 10 years of the time, you're looking at the time.
The next question that I've been often asked is, "Who is all the photos in the world?"
And yes, so much of all photos are being re-tated, but this is just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and it was also the very first time I had a Cogini. I didn't even have my time.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months before I was there, with my grandmother.
I'm the day of this Shub.
I had to be embarrassed with my friend.
I'm at a Pyjama party, a few days ago a Shubday for the French bird.
I'm a football team and the V.C. magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
It's constructed, and it's a group of professional workers, from Hariphus and Podler and psychiatrists and photographers and all the students and their students and the post-fatching and the stock. They're not. I'm not.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "When are you doing things free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m
I grew up in Cambridge and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money. And you had my clothes for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend with a terrible driver, and she was talking about a red light, and of course, we were crying. It took a -- it took me a -- "Make, Mr. Teszler," and we could go back.
I've got this costless stuff because of my view, and not because of my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their appearance and not pay attention to their personality.
I live in New York and from the 140,000 teenage athletes who were running out in the last year, and they were 85 percent of black and Latino and young men.
It's only in New York, only 17,000 young young young young men, male and Latino, who don't say, "Who am I talking?"
But, "How often I'm going to stop? When I was going to stop?"
I found out that talk for my research, that 14 percent of all the year-old girls don't like their body, and this number goes up at the top of the age of the age of the age of the age when they've been 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit cute and a little bit of a little bit-y hair, you feel very happy and great."
And then we're going to give a answer that might have shown this impression.
And we say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
It's true, but it's just one half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, which I never said before the camera, is, "I feel uncomfortable."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my view every day.
And if you've ever wondered, "How lucky I'd be happier if I had a thin legs and white hair?"
And then you should have to meet some micro-capses, because they have the most thin legs and the most cool hair and the most cool worm and they are probably not aware of their appearance on the planet.
When I was ready to get this talk, it was very hard to move me to a more difficult, because at the other hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come here and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile of mine who was stuck in my neck." And it doesn't feel very happy to be happy."
It was very difficult to keep a legacy of gender violence and race when I'm one of the biggest use of the number of dollars.
But I'm also happy and I'm happy to stand here, and I think it's great to do this before 10 or 30 years, before my career and my career has been still been still a career, because I would not tell my first job, or I would not be surprised as a job as I was so successful as I was so successful as I was so successful as I was.
So if you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our madness and misfort.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came from life in the e-mat, "Son, Thoyi Arafi.
But I'm never going to be like a Gafafafi Revolution."
There are almost two years since the Sistine Revolution, the waves of mass mass and in both the ethnic revolution.
I was with many other grandcowers, within the outside and outside of the day to challenge the anger and to start a revolution against the aristocracy.
And there she was there, a big revolution.
Boy, Leby-wollated women and men were in the first row, the end of the authorities, were looking at Slogi's freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They have shown to the unexpected courage by being on the war of the nonviolent dictator of Gafisis.
You have a strong sense of the sacredity of the east of the Middle East, until the south, to the south.
And finally, after six months of ancient war and almost 50,000 dead deaths, we had to let our country go out and the tyrant.
But Mafi has a great criminal bank, a legacy of the tyri, the corruption and the foundation of the process.
There have been four decades to have Gafafafis's Lawian regime and infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The most profound and the challenges, I realized how many other women are going to build the civil society back to Lyuuia. We asked a re-dated and global democracy.
In fact, 80 organizations were built in the case as well as the Thahafah in Benhakakah, almost 300 in Portel Park.
After 33 years in the Exst, I came back to Lyy, and with a unique enthusiasm, I started to organize the performance of human development and leadership.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of leadership, a movement of women's leadership, leadership, leadership-to-life-life-life-life-life-life-life-life-life-life-sourced, which is a public-sourced and our survival of leadership.
I met in the career career, I met a very hard environment, a environment that was more powerful, and a environment that was defined by the selfish politics of dominance and purpose.
I went to a initiative of peace platform with a national mastery women to reach a legal law, a law of any citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to choose to win and to stop the right and to address the gender and female female female-based and a broad-scale score.
And at the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 60 percent of the nation's national war in the first year for 24 years.
But very, the most clearly, the most significant age of the elections and the whole revolution, because every day we were looking for new news.
We were looking at the venter of ancient mosques and Sufi.
And then we got a message about the murder of the American property and the attack on the message.
And then, one morning, the suicide bomder were violated by the army.
And in fact every day, we've been standing under the law of the G.N. and their development against the human rights and their pre-porded laws.
Our society, from a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, they were at the beginning.
Curiosity and r<unk>uction were the symbols of the Scra Age of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our success-to-re-re-re-re-re-re-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we've been in a nation who's having the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We've been doing our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't have peace or safety in Lyyia.
Did the extraction and the change between female and female rights and national peace?
No, she's not.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to continue to continue to democratize polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the rest of the aristocracy and the rest of men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only who was afraid of, but the female values of compassion, the Good and the one.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a molecular interaction as it needed to be the elections at the end, and at the end, the polarization of the polarization.
Our society needs the extraction of the woman's favorite of the female as they need to have the standard, negativeness of the woman.
We have to stop the name of the anger and to ask a day of the R.
We have to start with the name of compassion and the Gabbood.
We have to develop a female discourse that didn't just confession the other values, but also to be honest, so that Gissess, instead of cooperation, instead of competition, instead of a failure.
These are the ideals that has to be a war-tared, and they need to be able to get peace.
Because peace has a alocie and in this Alocie's room, it's about the culility of the feminist and the pianist.
That's the real-e-e-e-might.
And we have to do this in generalized before we do it sociological.
A lie from the Koran's "Salalam," peace-in-the-the-mear word of the most beautiful God."
The word "wear", which is known in all the early 1960s, the same Arab root of the word as "The mother" and the symbol of the Jewish warrior, the whole life of humanity, the man and the female, and the most of all the people who are all born.
And just like the mother's eye of the embryo that grows in his own, completely so much the reason of compassion is the whole existence of the existence.
So we said, "My Goy's always put all the things."
So we said, "My Goy Hood's funeral for me to my beloved."
We're all going to be the Gabbel.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best thing to the world, and I grew up with the song "The Wear."
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been looking at the story of Kim K-mur, but we didn't learn very much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and our enemies are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until everything is different.
I saw a public route at the first time, and I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer hunger.
But in the year of 2005, my mother brought a letter with the sister of a colleague.
And then, you've got this, "If you're looking at this, our five family members are not going to be more there because we've had been eating two weeks.
We're together on the ground and our body are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I was listening to the first time that people were stuck in my country.
I went back to the highway, and I saw something horrible, which I can't be able to delete from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a little kid in her arm was smelled in his face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because everyone was so busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
In the end, there were more than a million North American Indians who were hungry and many more, because they ate grass, and the slime mold.
So, the power are more likely to be, so at night, it's all about me, except the lights of China on the other side of the pyramid where we've been there.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture from North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the Arctic, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very much more and allow North Carolina to escape.
But many die.
I was looking at the body with the body.
I can't tell a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while I was sent to the more violent family to China.
I just thought that I would be separated for a short time from my family.
I had never thought it needs 14 years to work back again.
In China, it was very hard to live in India than a young girl without family.
I had no idea how life would be like North Carolina as North Carolina, but soon, I realized it's not just very difficult, but it's also very difficult to be very expensive, but because North Korea are seen by illegal migrants in China.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
One day, my biggest lady's room, when I was trapped from the Chinese police, and in the police department, the police department.
Somebody was willing to be my name to be North Carolina, so they tested my Chinese events and I had many questions.
I had so scared, I thought I would have been going to get my heart.
So, I could be immorted, and I could be trapped in and be rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made my feelings to control my feelings and then I thought the questions.
After they've been done with the questions, a police officer said, "That was a cool deal.
It's not North-mathor."
And they went to me. It was a miracle.
Some North Korea, he's going to find out in China in the foreign news with the foreign messages calledyl, but many of them are thrown from the Chinese police.
These girls had great happiness.
Although they were raped, they finally ended up with a huge international pressure.
These North9-Americans didn't have so much happiness.
Every year, there are many North Korea in China, and they're being thrown up to North Korea, where they're being re-fated or lived in public or at the year.
Although I had my happiness, it's not so many North Carolina.
It's tragic that North Korea are hiding their identity and hard to fight.
After they learned a new language and work, their world can be put their world in a moment.
So after 10 years of the shock, I decided to go to South Korea, and again, I started a new life.
In South Korea, I was a bigger challenge when I thought it was.
In South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I have seen the big difference between North Central and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but in the inside, we've been very excited about a series of view, because of 14 years.
I was working on a identity crisis.
I'm a South or North Carolina-old?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't realize the tour of the South Korean life that I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording of the university.
I was just more interested in my new life, I got a sad call.
The North Bronx Department started to take the money I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was moved to the open place in a remote place.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started to plan to plan the escape.
North Korea have to take a tremendous route back to their way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between Northwest and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made me back to the top of the Northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to be trained to fund them, to over 2,000 miles from China and then after South Asia.
And the bus took a week, and we've been getting almost thrown up a lot of times.
One day when the bus was beaten, a Chinese police police police officer came in.
And he took the point of all, and then started asking questions.
And there's no Chinese understood my family, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, I decided to be accepted and said they were a kid, and I was her head-head.
He looked at me in my mind as a little bit of "Dicistic," but luckily, he believed me.
And we managed to take the back to the vertical border, but I had to take almost all my money to the border of L.R.
But after we've been out of the border, my family was involved in the border of illegal border.
And after I had paid money for a prison and a shower, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was re-founded, in the capital of L.R.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to keep my family out of the freedom, and we were so close to that, but my family was arrested just before the South Bronx.
I went out and forth between the foreign railroad and the police Council, and I was trying to open my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back and pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then, the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised to acknowledge that a stranger is paying attention to it.
In the broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without a bank to a bank, and paid the money for my family and two North Carolina to get out of jail.
And I was talking to him about the very sest heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't give you." He answered.
I'm going to give the North Bronx Asian people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
Now, before the previous stranger who were largely centralized me to a new hope that the North Korea needed so much to do, and he showed me the dedication of strangers and the support of the international community as the most honest ones that need to do the North Koreans.
And finally, after our long journey, my family and I moved back into South Korea, but the freedom of the freedom is only to get a step.
Many North Korea are separated from their families, and as they come out in a new country, they start with a little bit more or less money.
The international community can help us in education, the English learning, the education education and a lot more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside, because many of us are still in contact with family services, and we send them information and money to change North Korea.
So I had so lucky to get a lot of help and inspiration in my life that I want to be the most passionate of North Carolina to be successful at success, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful American North America on the world, but also at the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you a request today.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and a lot of good-time.
He can't speak, but he's also obsessed with joy in a way that there might be some of the best speakers.
Remi knows what love is.
It's a lot of it, and it's taking them unfinished.
It's not too aggressive. He's not looking at the skin color.
It doesn't care about religious differences and you're just telling yourself: He never told a lie.
When he's sitting on his childhood songs from our childhood, he's trying to be in words that I'm not even even sure, he reminds me about one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel's 17 is big. He's very good at the same.
It has a absolutely unconcessable memory.
It also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he's got my chocolate hair-taughter, but he reminds him the book of my iPod, the conversation that we had when he was four, when he was four, when the first one of the Failer had my arm and his daughter's birthday.
Don't listen to them?
But a lot of people are not right.
And indeed, because your mind isn't in the social version of normal, they're often understood and wrong.
But what my heart was encouraged and my soul had been influenced, is that although it was not as usual, it could be just one of them, that they were extraordinary -- mental and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "coodism," it's a complex function of the brain, the social communication, and sometimes the learning abilities.
It's also different in every individual, and it's called Sii's so different as Sam.
And all of the time, in the world, every 20 minutes of autism has been discovered in a new autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing urbanization in the world, there's no known cause of defense or failure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it any day.
I was just a three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He's a lot of a lot.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and actually, he didn't really think about me.
Si lived and raised his own world with their own rules, and he found joy in the smallest things, like cars in a row to eat the machine and eat everything that came out.
And as he became older, he became different and the differences were visible.
But behind the anger and the bar and the shump was never a really different thing: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any unconscious, a human being.
Amazingly remarkable.
Well, I can't even have some more challenging moments in my family, moments of moments that I wish they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these things I wouldn't want to be on with equality.
So, the beauty of the distinction that the differences give us the difference, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It's just to say that there's another kind of thing from right.
And if I could say one thing to Sii and Sam to you, then you'd have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autism or not the differences we have -- we have a gift. Everyone has a gift to us. And in all of all of all of honesty, is the ultimate potential of the potential.
The chance to do the scale, progress and change in the moment when we try to be like someone else.
Please say, "You don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Docon has made us with silence and curiosity, with this photo, with a project that's a robot that's covered through a paper, and with a mass of war, only one year.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography that's the F-M-M-A-Dold photographer, a new technology that is so fast that it can create a slow-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-
And so we can build cameras that look at the view of our view of the view of the view of the view of the view of the outside, or not a mouse image in our body, and actually ask what we call my camera.
Now, if I take a laser map and I take it in a billionth of a second, and I can look at it -- this is several-minute-by-by-up-by-by-mouch, I'm going to make a laser satellite photograph, which is barely a millimeter of photograph, and this is going to turn it into the speed, and it's going to be a little bit faster than a million times a new project.
So if you take this project, this satellite satellite satellite, and you put it in this bottle like these photons are going to break in the bottle?
So what's going on in time is light-in-fub?
So this whole event --
So, you think, the whole event is actually going to take less than a nanoscopic -- so it takes the light to go back, but I'm going to get this video to 10 billion billion dollars to see the light.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So in this film, a lot of happens, so let me explore this, and show you what happened.
The pulse, our project, is in the bottle with a photocel, which starts to move through the distance, and then the end of the bubble is flowing.
And the part of the light goes down to the table and you see the explosion of the waves.
Now, many of the photons are finally going to get the arm and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's going to be out in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves on the table are coming out and because of the lens, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a typical project and you're going to take the same route back and then take the video back to 10 billion billion, you know how long you've got to sit here to see the film?
Day a day, a week? No. No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And how does it look like a little life-time photographer?
You can see how these waves are going on the table, the Tom Cross and the wall on the background.
It's like you put a mountain in a pond.
And it was like the nature looked like this, a picture, every single picture, but of course, our eye looks together.
But if you look at this Tom Cross, you'll see that if the light comes out of the Tom Cross, that's not going to be moving. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom Cross is now, and the light in her way up and over a few-dimensional seconds.
So in the future, if this M-M-M-M-M-M-M- camera is built in your camera in your room, it could be possible to go into a supermarket and find if you're a fruit, you can't touch it at all.
So how did my team built this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a picture with a long-term war, you've got very little light, but we've got a different amount of time faster than your short-term explosion, so you're not going to get any light.
So we're going to do this project, we're going to send this satellite satellite satellite satellite, and we're going to draw this satellite satellite, and then we're going to combine it with very clever visual synchronization and combine these nanometers from data to create these micro-s.
And we can take all these raw data data and do very interesting things.
So, as you can fly, you know, Coke can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future super-grandetic superheras: to see the outside?
The idea is that we're going to put a little light on the door.
It's going to be re-citting, in the room, and part of it is going back to the door and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these more extracellularities of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it.
On the left, our FMMMM camera.
On the wall, a glass is hidden, and we're going to let the light go down to the door.
And after our paper in the GRA Center, the Global Trade Center was published, it was covered by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be able to put these light data back, and they're going to be able to put it back into the wall and this photocodel cell phone in every direction, and some of the photographs are going to be able to get our hidden glass, and then then then then then then the door will turn the light into a tiny chunk and a tiny chunk, and then it's going to be able to get the tiny, and it's going
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our FMMM camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time to go and look at the world in the speed of the speed.
And of course, we know the distance of the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by taking a laser, we can take a little bit of a functional picture, which is, as they look at the screen -- but if we're taking a lot of these pictures, these pictures, and then try to analyze the different light-like light-like object, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our development process.
We have a lot of things to do before we could do the lab in practice, we could use cars to avoid the events that are out there, and we can look at the curve at the line of the line, and we can look at the light from the window, or we can see the back-up, or the back-up, and then we can see the body's going to see the body.
But because of the blood and tissue, this is a very challenging thing, which is, of course, is, this is really a call for scientists, now thinking about the F-B-R-A-A-Dold photographer, because there's a new visual process that could actually solve the next generation of medical development.
So, like Coconononon, even a scientist, the science has become a art art, a art art of the ultra-dimensional photography, and I realized that all of these nanometers that we're using every time we're using, we can't use the scientific design process. So we can also use a new visual image of the brain and play on the side, and we can't look at the time.
But it's also something fun about it.
And if you look at these waves under the bag of the bag, you can see that the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move us to move.
What happens here?
And it turns out that we've been able to take almost in the speed of light, weird effects and Einstein would like to have been so amazing.
The order to do the data in the world is to appear in the camera in a way, so by using the relationship between space and time, we can apply those biases.
So no matter whether photography around the outside, or the design of a new visual repertoire for medicine or new design centers, since we've done all the details on our website and hope that the pro-mander community, and the research community, we should be able to start to stop the next three-dimensional video, and we should start to start to focus on the next three-dimensional video.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities, like our human beings can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many faiths are not passed. But we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit of like a hysterical and a circle.
And the projects came from my questions, how many money my neighbors are paying?
How do we pay more things to keep ourselves wrong with each other?
How do we share our memories on the distance of the building and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for free houses so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being covered by the huge e-section that have been paying for hundreds of young loved loved loved, drunk and white shadows. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone has never been, there's a par in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the most of the people in America.
I live in the room and thought about how I can do it, and I thought, I thought, I thought, I've also changed something that changed my life forever.
I lost somebody I loved very much.
His name was Joan and she was like a mother. She was suddenly suddenly lost and unexpected.
I've been thinking about death, and I felt a great passion for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep my view on the same view of every day.
It's easy to lose your daily life in the same time and forget what's really important.
With the help of old and new friends, I turned out a page of the house in a giant box, and I wrote a set of a body-through-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat, I want everyone to take a piece of chalk, think about your life and your public life.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you who were written by the people on the wall.
I'm going to be fired because I want to be concerned about Pragia."
I'm going to be hungry, I want to stand on the International Recover.
I'm going to be hungry for millions of people."
I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
I'm going to be hungry, I want to live in the web-tiving."
I'm going to die, I want to keep it in my poor."
I'm going to be hungry by the other time I want to be a guy's Kavavavic.
I'm going to be hungry, I want to be myself.
This was considered a meaningful place, and the hopes and the dreams of the people brought me to laugh, and the wine and the hard time.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and to understand it in a new way and more and more inclusive.
It's about creating place for us and thinking and remember what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've got hundreds of news messages that were working with their community with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a building software building and now have been built in countries like Krazan, South Africa, South Africa, East Africa, and other walls.
We've shown how much power have our public spaces when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are, time and relationships to other people.
In a world with more intense distractions, it's more important than ever ever ever ever seen the things that look at the right view and think that life is too short and depressed.
We're often being rejected to talk about death, or even thinking about it, but I realized that the effort on death is one of the things that we're most committed to.
The idea of death is to express us the life.
We're most interested places that are best in our best and as individuals as a community, and more importantly, with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories that people can't help us live around and help us to help better places to live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in math. A special problem for everyone who's busy working with a more sophisticated math, is that we are like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to try this today to explain what I do.
And dance is one of the most human activity.
We're looking at the sight of the Marberber ball and the waitors as you're going to see.
So if the ball is a remarkable amount of knowledge and abilities and abilities, and maybe a basic representation that could have a genetic component.
Now, unfortunately, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slow up as this extraordinary potential. That's what it also does for me to the people who were in my native vystes, who had been a ball accident for his time.
You've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet, there are two million people in the world who suffer in this disease, and they have to suffer with the unconpoodable symptom of weakness, like weakness, and other people live with the disease, so we need to identify the response to discover the disease.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and finally the only way to know if there's a cure to know if we have an objective scale that can answer this question.
So, in trouble, there's a lot of intelligence for Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing to do is this 20-minute test.
It has to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive. It means that outside clinical studies, never been done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
So if it was a professional tour in the hospital, and what if patients could do this test?
It wouldn't have a brand hospital.
It costs 300 percent to look at the neurological field.
So I want to suggest you about a non-term method that we're trying to do with this, because we're all at least in some sense, virtual, like I am to call Rululese.
Here's a video of the visual arm.
This happens in the healthy state when someone's made a speech. We can look at the wrong ball, because we have to use all these motor devices, if we've got to make the type of mood, and we've got to make all the genes for the case.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk to it until it's learning.
And the way that we can see is the position of the neural arm, and that's how the ant is affected by Parkinson's brain stimulation.
On the bottom stage, you can see an example of the extracellularual repertoire of the discourse.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's a real, weakness, carmess.
It's even a language that's going to be more lonely and more lonely and more and more like this, and this is an example of the case.
Now, the effects of the voice can be standardized, sometimes with digital microphones and the same-contite technology, combined with new machine learning learning, which is now very advanced, we can now see where someone is in a space between disease and health, and the mood.
So, how can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-in-murious. The test with neurologists.
Very little. The infrastructure has already been there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are exactly exactly right. They're not doing the same thing.
So you can do it in their own self-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-through.
They're very fast, they're at 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a large scale.
So these amazing goals, we can now do this.
We can reduce professional difficulty for patients.
There's no way to do a routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through the long-term observation.
We can do low-tech efforts for clinical studies and first study a study of the entire population.
So we have the opportunity to search on the first time to search on the disease before it's too late.
We're going to do the first step in this direction, we're starting to start to start the Parkinson's disease.
So we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough extra dimensions to have the potential to get the results to the task.
We have a reputation number of three-dimensional numbers on the planet.
Anyone with Parkinson's disease or without using cheaply to leave pictures for a few cents. I'm talking to joy, we've already done six percent of our goal in the end of the end of the next 24 hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from the data, we'll say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who's not healthy and who?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be told when the phone has to be suffering in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some people may not do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are in order to figure out what's the actual text for Parkinson's disease.
Is it your 22 percent of accuracy at the time?
It's much better.
My students Thisis -- I have to make it a little bit, because he's done this fantastic work -- now it's also also working on the mobile network, which is what's going to do with this project, and we're at 99 percent.
I call this a function.
That means that people can call the phone -- people can call the phone with the phone, and we could call the test with Parkinson's disease, so that their voice can take the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Max Kanzi, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the Southwest of the Central Park.
You can see the cows in the background, and the night behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi Park Center is just a little bit more, and that means that all the wild animals can leave the park at the same time.
The symbols that the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows who killed in night. I woke up in the morning, and she found dead. It was terrible. It was our only Hulk.
My tribe, the tribe of the Southaiai, thinks that we were together with our animals and the Sabbath of the sky, so we were going to tell our animals so much.
I learned to hate lions.
Our ancestors of our warrior. They protect our stem stem and our native tribe. They are also also also involved in this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so many lions in the Nairobi Park.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years of his father's death for his father. So it was also my life.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that we didn't really want to help us, but also the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't go. I went on. I did it.
I had a second idea. I tried to take it with a bird.
I wanted to think that the lions thought I was next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You can see the bird's Day and go back and go back the next time, but they come back and say, the thing is not going to move, that's still there.
And they go out and kill our livestock.
I was looking at the pall. I went to the hand with a bar in the hand around it, and this time, the lions didn't get there.
And lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
And as a little boy, I worked all day in my room in my room, and once the new radio, I once had a new radio, and the day, she brought me almost too much to work on electronics.
I took a old car battery and a balance-to-preated car from a motorcycle. It shows if you want to turn your right or the right, or the right. He'd like to turn it.
And I turned up a switch to turn the lights out and down.
This is a little egg from a broken lamp lamp.
And then I built all together.
The solar-in-in-in-in-in-in-through the battery, the battery is the electricity of the power. I call it a blend.
And the balance of the car is blinking.
You can see that the orange is looking for the outside, because the lions come there.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights and the lions believe that I'm going to go to the edge. And that's where I was the whole time in bed.
Thank you.
So I've been running this in home for us, and since I've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors were listening to them.
One of them was this grandmother.
They had lost a lot of animals in lions, and they asked me if I could build the lights.
And I said, "Yeah."
I was able to visualize the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've been eating seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights of the lights and they're working well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other symbols like hygiene or the slime mold, and the lights are also also also used to keep elephants from the outside.
My invention was a scholarship to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brook Street School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been involved and helps to participate through the investment and education.
I even put my friends home and we've built the lights in there where there's no one there, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I just sat out a boy from the savanna who was crying his cows. I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a box!"
And here I'm here.
I had to visualize a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and pilot. This is my great dream.
I used to meet lions. But through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, we can live in the side with the elephants, without any argument.
Mart Ol<unk>n<unk>. In my language, this means that, thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this campaign. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list?
My next invention, now, I work on a electrical fence. A electroricie?
Yeah, I know that electrical pava has been invented for long, but I want to have my own own.
You've been trying to do it, not true, yeah, I've been trying to take the back because I got a catch.
And it's hard. Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to be transported to your head-up, my friend.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
I'm old enough to keep a camera in the hand, I'm a photographer, I'm a photography. But today I want to share with you 15 minutes. And I'm going to share my favorite pictures. And I'm not one of them.
There was no kind of a design model, no style, no idea to shoot a picture. Not even to be re-canging the lighting.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by the previous tour media.
My story starts to start with a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I was in her first birthday on my birthday. We were at the corner of 57 and five.
And so last year, we were back to New York City, and so we decided to actually stop the same picture.
Well, you can see what's going on there ...
When the third birthday came closer to my daughter, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you look at Sinaina at New York and do it a father-old son to go back to the ritual?"
So we started asking the venter tour arts tours to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable, as universal visual expression is when you're having a completely stranger to get his camera.
Nobody has never said no, and fortunately, nobody's still stuck with our camera.
And then, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
And this journey has become very lonely.
This was just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day, so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than a single moment, or a certain journey.
They are also a possibility for us a week in October October, and how we change our time and how we change our year, not only in the same way that we're looking at, but in the same time.
Because even though we do the same picture, our view changes as long as it's going to be done, while it's going to be able to see new spaces, I can see the life with their eyes, and how it looks like it.
So this very intense time that we spend on each other is something we expect and every year.
So, as one of our travel, we went back to the city, and suddenly, they stayed like they're standing in a red driver on a car like a kid who had learned to learn to travel in early days.
And she told me about her feelings that she had been in the same time as five-year-old,
She said that she remembered her heart of the chest when she saw nine years ago in the first time.
And now she looks at New York to high school schools, because she really wants to study in New York.
And I was very clear: The most important thing we're creating is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of this idea, a active role in the unconceptive memory.
I don't know how it looks like you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at a family photo.
I'm always the one that's doing the picture.
I want to encourage everyone today to come up with the picture and ask someone to ask you, "Would you do a picture of us?"
Thank you.
