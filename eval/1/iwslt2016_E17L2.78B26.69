When I was 11 years old, I was stabbed one morning by the sounds of the thumb-of-the-white joy.
My father stopped his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual back then, because the news was largely depressing.
He called "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school," he said.
I will never forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban intervened the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned giving birth to school.
And so I was committing for five years as a boy and supporting my older sister who had no longer been allowed to go on their own to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school, and we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different path so nobody could guess where we were going.
We're hiding our books in shopping bags so we'd just go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
In the winter, it was embarrassing, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over and over again, the class had to come out for a week because the Taliban had been bleeding.
We were never quite sure how much they knew about us.
Did they stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we wanted to go to school anyway.
I had been very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and women were valued.
My grandfather had taken a long ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was violated by his father.
My mother grew up, but she became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire only to transform our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received an education.
And to him, it was always clear that his children would get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much bigger risk of not sending his kids to school.
I know right now that in the years of the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated about our lives, the constantly fear and the internal resilience.
I had good courage to give up. But my father said, "Toy, please stop me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen from your money. You can be displaced in the war from your house.
But one thing will remain with you, which is what's in there. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we'll be doing that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree as a high degree as a high school, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly goddant of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he had let his daughters send to school, one of the first people to challenge me.
He doesn't just pushes me with high school, but also to say I was the first woman and I was who drives him with the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helped to start CDLA, the first and maybe the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school paper for girls is still risky.
It's wonderful to see students in my school who are very ambitious with great ambition, they're all trying to see opportunities that they're offering.
And look at their parents and fathers as they stand for them, as well as my parents for me then, despite all the opposite concerns.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students' father.
It was just a month ago that his daughter and he was on the way home from SOLA in her village, and they were out of death through a bomb on the side by a road just a few minutes.
When he got to home, the phone rang and a voice threatened to get him to school if he sent his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "Well, now if you want, I'm not going to put my daughter's future in the game because of your old-fashioned and over-reached ideas."
In terms of Afghanistan, I've realized something that is often not appreciated in the West: that behind most of us, the success is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that her success is also success.
That's not to say that our mothers don't really matter in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones who are starting to come and they're more compelling to their little future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And the Taliban were only going to school a few hundred girls -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan today, over three million girls are pressing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be from America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid the change are not over the length and the development of the U.S. troops are changing.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are helping them, who are helping them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan, for me, is a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities, and every day, it reminds me the girls who go the SOLA.
Like me, they have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including working, my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I see young, not very -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on projects of engineering with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I, 21 years, I thought that we're a good man in Italy and we're earning good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we first measured.
Our first project, which was inspired my first book, "Ripples on the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show people like Sambias to grow food.
We got to Southeast Italian seed farmers, in this sliding valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local citizens to grow Italian tomatoes and to Bechini.
Of course, the local peoples had absolutely no interest in doing this, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such a fertile valley of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Wait time to save the people of Sambias from the starvation."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatoatoes. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, like agriculture is easy."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, over the night, about 200 nesting pits were coming out of the river and graded everything.
We said to the Hebrew, "Oh God, the nilies!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian, so great carpigues in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French countries were doing, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the valleys.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we've never hated the world's never-for-the-world people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read their book.
Check out about a African woman who's done what we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, paconomicists, and there are only two ways we deal with people, we colonize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both of these words are from the Latin root, which means "pater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat each culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisier: I suffer each other's culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called "brust," boss.
I was sent up when I read the book "mmizall" by the singing. He said, most importantly in economics, if people don't want help, let them calm down.
This is the first principle of the aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
And this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, set up a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolpedate?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people and I invented a system called business, where nobody was being initiated, nobody will ever be motivated, but you will become the service of the local passion, the local talent, the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get to a community with ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We don't work from offices.
We're in cafes. We're in cafes. We're in knellipes.
We don't have infrastructure.
We close friends and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can convey an idea to someone.
If this person doesn't like this, what do you want to do?
The passion for your growth for the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing for humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea might not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this trap: Why not going to get into a community and say to people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You've never had entrepreneurs in a part, and they're never going to say publicly what they want to do with their money, what are they seeing for opportunities.
You have planning that blindfold.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to public meetings.
We work with one to do that, to do that, we need to be producing social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the Children's hospital, the local community of the company, who sits with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the tools, your passion to make life change.
I tried this in vitileity, West Australia.
I tweetted at the time, and I tried to escape the flashing flaws where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, I had my first customer, and I helped him get fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth and organize a restaurant. And then the fishermen came to the street and said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped my work with these five fishermen, working together, and I couldn't sell this wonderful tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per hour, but to Japan for John Sushi for 15 dollars at the 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them do us?" Can you help us?"
I had a year of work, I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- So the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that go to loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business leaders in the history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printer was a philosophy professor before he was dealing with companies. Peter's printer said, "Take is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
You're planning for the death of entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest man Christchurchens want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get this one to get you.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come to be inconveniment.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For what presentation you most cheated tomorrow?
"Sit, loving people. You've cheated them.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way to go.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- decisable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freonart of Environment is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, install, transport, and can correspond to them.
The technologies that don't exist for that.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it!
The government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're going to do it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they would speculate what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population is growing on this speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap done with six million horses.
Because they've been going under the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that's feeding lives from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing that you have to do is to get discourse.
They don't come to talk to you and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is provide them absolute, committed and passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest and the biggest company, everyone has to be able to perform three things: It has to be great, grand-compensator, it has to be great, it has to be great, it has to be massive to finance.
You know what?
We never met a single person who can produce something simultaneously, sell and care about money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iystiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been in common with, one thing that's not just one person's been founded.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them the classroom, and we start giving them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the job of the 16 undergraduate is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons autobiography, how often he uses the word "I" and how often the word "weeds."
Never "I" and 32 times we.
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one founded a company alone. No one started it.
So we can create a community where the facilitators who have a small business background in cafes and bars, their loved buddy, who are going to do what someone for this gentleman who talks about this E. Somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What do you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support business organizations to help them find the tools and people in the middle, and we've found that the wonderful ideas of the health of the local population are going to change the culture and the economy of that community can only begin to capture the passion and power and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago how it must be to be Alice in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communication -- manageable engineers in communication.
I was afraid --
Fear at these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, my trusted words.
But when they got into the conversation, it was like Alice, when she went down to the case of the case of the pig, and he saw a door in a whole new world.
And just like that, I felt like I was having conversations with the students, and I was amazed at the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this wonder country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones who are going to take our biggest problems, like energy and environment and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I believe that it's in our responsibility as a non-religistist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up with us.
I want to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're dealing with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to us is: Okay, so what?
Does it tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us right now.
Not only does their stomachs study, but it also tells us that their stomachs, their plastic structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat ootherocosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you'll have the stuff that you do, and then you'll call it illegal arguments.
In the words, a barrier is an understanding your thoughts.
Sure, you could use your "F" and you could use it in time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more intuitive for us?
To make your thoughts understandable, it's not the same as to download your level.
As Einstein said, "You know, things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, a few things about this is that you can look at examples, examples, stories and analogies. So in this way, you can move us into your boss.
And when your work is presented, the points are going away.
Have you ever asked why it's called the point?
What happens when someone gets to the head? Another one is going to be stabbed, and with those dots, the first person you're going to see your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also also fits on the very well-being of our brain, and that's why we're getting really excited about it.
This example of Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It shows that the specific structure of the worm is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, curable sentence where the audience can lose the thread, once it loses the thread, use images and graphics that also encourage our senses and thereby creates a deeper understanding of what it represents.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up those doors and see the wonderful country that compares science and technology.
And because the engineers I've been teaching are taught to make the "The Slice in me" tight, I want to sum up everything with an equation.
If you look at your science and you look at your sub-cogs and your sub-pits, you'll be sharing your supervision, which is what's important to the audience, and multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work. And that's what makes possible changes that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a cell phone with a human phone, you can film a crime in Syria.
You can tweet a cell phone and start a postage in Egypt.
And you can take a cell phone and you can take a song and you can get it up in the sound cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin year of 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back in that time in this city.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people going to the road and demonstrated how they were going to change.
We've been in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who were coming and asking change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Keep it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every cell phone today has a cell phone.
But today, my cell phone and my cell phone wants to talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full of information.
Tumpets.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.S. embassy has set up a policy line.
So this is a policy line called the Department of Security Center.
And the point is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls for? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message to?
And if you use a cell phone where you are.
All of this information is stored on the order of every two months from your phone company or your Internet service company.
And everywhere in Europe, people have stood up and said, "We don't want that."
They said we don't want to do this plan-proofing system.
We don't want to have self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everyone said, "We don't want that."
And here you can see tens of thousands of people migrating around the streets of Berlin and saying, "Fake out fear rather than fear."
And some even said this could be on Stum 2.0.
The Stasi was the Lufle police in eastern Germany.
And I also wonder if this really works.
Can all of this information really store over us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the German Telecommunications company, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send all the information that saved her over me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get the right answer. Just the darken Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been going on with it, and it's been tracking it.
So I decided to put a legal court on it because I wanted this information.
But the German post said no, no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I pull back the charges of what they're going to send to all of these resources.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was a legitimate violation.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD, that was it.
35830 lines of information.
I first looked at it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized after a while: That's my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called the home supply.
So with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see me drive from Frankfurt with the train to get to the Cl<unk>n, and how many calls I'm going to go along the way.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm calling my wife and she calls me up, and we're talking with each other a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up and call you up, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how many times they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything you can see.
You can see the central figures, like who are leaders in the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what makes society a society.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to whom to send an email, all of which is possible if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I first said, let's imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, in the bedside, had mobile phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if Stasi knew who the leaders were, it might have never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And also, the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today, the government agencies and companies today want to store so many information on how they can get over us, online and offline.
They want the chance to pursue our lives, and they want to store it all at a long time.
But self-determination and life in the digital age are not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every single day.
So when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, tell your bosses, just because companies and government places have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long yet.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company after the information they saved over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight the self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Inverted carriers, rapid-performance restaurants, Brakkak spaces.
So the city planers are going to come together and they're thinking about changing the name of South Central, so that it's meant for something else, they're changing it in South Los Angeles, as if that's changing something that's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Inverages, rapid restaurants, plumbing, flat spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Shrus and the Drivebys.
The committees are that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a preventable condition.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I found that skirt chairs bought and sold like use of use.
I see a dialysis center going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I was going to have a little bit of a 15-minute meeting to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food hotspot in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park park.
It's at 12 feet.
The thing is, it's part of the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want because it's my responsibility and I have to stay there."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started planting my food hot and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a stock group, put together by gardening from all the social layers and from all the city, it's completely free and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a planner, and said I had to remove my garden, the carrier became a connotation.
And I thought, "Yeah, yeah?
A narrative of how we grow food in a piece of land that you're totally not care about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city bank and a member of Green Ground, and they signed a petition on Chair.org, and we succeeded in 900 papers.
We kept the victory in the hands.
In fact, my townmate called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. In the United States, most of the palches in the property of the city have in the property.
They have 67 square kilometers in Brakak's room.
That's 20 Central Parks.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell shouldn't they find that okay?
And by growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get the dollar worth of fruit and vegetables on the value of 75 dollars.
It's my cure, I tell people to grow their own food.
To grow its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of these pre-made reality that's made by other people, and I built my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Gardenwork is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Like a graffiti artist who is cycling the walls, I'm going to break lawns and parking lots of wood.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my closesties for the stuff.
You would be surprised to see what the ground the ground is if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the soil.
You'd wonder how children are influenced by it.
and gardening is the most therapeutic and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get strawberry more than that.
I remember that time that mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked at it like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not reason on the street."
I was shocked when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and it only empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye, no, I'm not afraid they were squeaks.
It's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
In another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to upload the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it stored with her mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it only had a moment for a moment.
Green grassves have planted about 20 gardens.
And in our retro-grilled programs, it came as 50 people and they did it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon, they eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get any of that, if they don't show how food is affected by the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever you're accusing them.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are right on the path that they were looking for, and they don't go nowhere.
The gardening are a chance to see where we can train these children to care for their communities to live sustainable lives.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could produce the next George Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground floor, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship carts and turn them into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snoring because it's not sustainable.
The point of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets and getting them the joy, the pride and the honor of building food when you open up your own food and open farmers markets.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gangs.
We need to turn the picture of the weather around.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a hike, you know?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet with me, don't call me up if you want to sit in smart chairs and make a meeting where you talk about doing anything.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skirt, in my backyard so that we can plant some sniffs.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford English is "nollygaster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And it's "nnnollyvy" means "inctless politicians."
Although a newspaper host in the 19th century was awarded a better definition: "A Snolly Monolly Future is someone who decides to compete, independent of party or program or postings, and his success by having the pure power of validation."
I have no idea what the treatment is.
I think something about words.
But it's really important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to control language.
So for example, 1771, for example, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not going to miss the exact vocabulary of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went back with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it a decision, but he was brave enough to pray, to defeat, and he ended up having so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first confession for the phrase "so strong like Brass." Many people believe.
It's hard for the English word for the tin.
But that's not true. It's going back to a defendance of the press of freedom.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you in the United States, at the time when it's just reached independence.
You'd see the question of what you'd call George Washington, the head of the head,
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader a universal nation?
In Congress, for an infinite amount of debate was debated.
And there were all kinds of possible ways to do things.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-food of George Washington, and then others, the propulsion of freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's not that sensitive.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought that was safe.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everyone was bored with it because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal of a senator who is always writing, "I'm going to have the same topic."
The reason for the delay and the boredness was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be a good. They didn't want to.
King calls it, and maybe even give it to ideas about his success.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most rutnous titles that they thought of.
This title was "Pountor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only believed that someone had a gathering.
Like a pre-testion like a jury.
He had no longer the size than the record "written" or "talk water."
Sometimes there were a handful of little prime ministers of common-class groups and government groups, but it was really a non-obvious title.
And so the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call it President.
This guy has to sign a paper and meet foreign officials.
Who will take it seriously if he has a stupid little title like President of America's United States?"
And also after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't give up.
Instead, we didn't think of using the term "the Primeity," but they were totally trying to make sense that they were not meant because of their honest respect for the opinions and institutions of civil nations, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's the office of the State of the State of the State of the State -- not necessarily devoid of the people who are not properly respected with the nations.
You can learn about it three interesting things.
First of all, and I think that's best -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate has ever been officially validated the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just celebrated the title, waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something is temporary -- you wait for 223 years later.
And third, and that's really important, that's the most important thing, is that the theme of the United States of America today doesn't sound as humbling as you know, right?
This is something that has more than 5,000 nuclear strawts that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the title size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They have got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the card of self-destess -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations do have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost because nobody feels humiliated when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the way that words change the reality more than words may ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 rebellion in combat with Mr. Dalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I'm going to put my black Conclight Mills against a pair of brown leather leather motels and heat a rocket towards the government headquarters I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For the long time, I'd grown up with the war, but next to Pyjama parties and football songs at the edge and commuting with racist South Africa and agnostic demonstrations that no one had ever known to travel with communism and Afghanistan for a long time, and arrival events that I knew would have been doing before.
But that's the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing here, born Afghane, Southstctions of God Gnnades, an atheist and a radical political artist who's been working and working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there are lots of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like rainbows. I want to make art that draws personalities and authority and references reality and re-writing reality and even use some kind of creative protocol to try to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the first day that conducts its jihad against communists like "Pop Staring" and used militant religious tourism and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the jihad official when to run for the parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I going to hire me! I'm fighting jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi to spend their way as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, with a project called "Runation," where you build a police officer on the streets of Kabul and keep cars on the streets of Kabul, but instead of taking bribes of them, rent money, and in the name of Kabul, the police department is apologizing them, and they hope that they will take us 100 dollars.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become the "citicient conflict."
The war and the other foreign views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I combine local homes with a shelter or several recycled warehouseworks to a developing super-engineer super-greened vendurbation.
And I'd like to see what a simple poker from Kabul looks like between 1899991 Appell to create a dialogue about the current development institutions that have roots in their past colonial rhetoric about "The Children's Guit" to protect the brown man in front of themselves and maybe even to cure them a little bit of civilized.
But for all these things, you can come to jail, they can be misinterested, misinterested.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your name?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel like this is now building an uncomfortable tension in the room, because I shouldn't have been attracted to this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little change on that.
This is the first time someone pulls himself on the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happiness that you're seeing that.
If some women were really stupid when I came out, you don't need me to say this later I read on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
Not everybody has the chance.
These elevations are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull out the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Now, why did I do that?
That was embarrassing.
Well, it's not hopefully embarrassing like this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also shallow.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never really had a friend of mine in my mind.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should be throwing my back and holding my hand in the hair of this guy.
And apart from surgeries or the wrong wires I took two days ago to work, there are very few ways of changing our utterances, and our expressions are -- although it's super-ficial and ineffective -- it's a huge impact on our lives.
To be fearful, to me, is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call that a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what is this legacy?
Well, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical in which we are programmed biologically, but also as big, shining, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that was handed out for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashion coach calls, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra. Joan Smalls. Lih."
And first I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But I'm sorry to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the run, each one of which was consumed, and that in 677 or less than four percent, they didn't know.
The next question that I've been asked is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown up?"
And I say to you, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is this little girl: "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of the United States or the inventors of the next Internet or a ninja psychiatric expert, which would be completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
And if they say that great counter, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American avian, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying you want to win the Jackosset in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I want to show you 10 years of working model knowledge, because unlike heart surgeons, it can only escape.
And when there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice cyclist, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture where you're going," now the leg goes first, it goes long, it goes back, that arm goes back, that arm, right in the back, the head is on the three-quarters, and you just move back and you just look back, you're going to your image, 300 times, four
It looks something like this.
It's less awkward than that in the middle.
I don't know what's happened there.
If you've finished school and you've done a lot of jobs, you can't say much, unfortunately, if you want to be president of the United States, but in life, "Take up 10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at weird.
The next question that I've been asked to do is, "Who is saving all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've taken, and this was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my course.
I know this will be quite personal right now, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months earlier, with my grandmother.
This is the day I get the day of this clip.
My friend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party, a few days before a magazine for the French bird.
This is me with a football team and a V magazine magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructors, and they're constructed a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and stylists and all their assistants and the protocols. They're building it. That's not me.
Okay, so next thing people ask me, people always ask me, "You're fighting stuff for free?"
Yes, I have a lot of 20 mulp shoes that I can't wear except, but the things that I get free are things that I get in real life and I don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a horrible driver, and she took a red light and of course we were stopped. It just took one, "Excuse me, Mr. Wiger Next World Cup," and we were able to keep going.
I've got these free things because of my appearance and there are no people who are looking at it and don't pay for their personality to a high price.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and filtered last year, 85 percent of black and Latino and mostly young men.
It lives in New York only 177 young, male and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When am I stopped?"
And in my research, I found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent if they've grown 17 percent.
The last question I have to say, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they expect this answer, "If you're a little bit thinner and glanced hair, you feel very happy and powerful."
And backstage gives you an answer that might convey this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel as much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera is, "I feel unsafe."
And I'm feeling confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I have happier if I had skinny legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some of these modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most bright hair and the coolest flakes, and they are because of their appearance, probably, the most uncertain women on the planet.
So when I prepared this talk, it seemed really hard to get me to a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable to come and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile that were pushed to my power." And it doesn't feel very good to add on the other, and it doesn't always make me happy."
It was very difficult, it was a legacy of oppression because of gender and race when I'm one of the biggest users of it.
But I'm happy and I'm honored to be standing here, and I find it's great that I've done here before 10 or 20 years of last, and my career has never yet been more anxious, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell you how I've paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misidentified and misbeherstanding.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who's come to life in exile, "Son, naddafi resistance. Being him.
But will never be like a Gaddafi revolution."
It's been now almost two years since the Libbyian revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass operations in both the Tunisian and Egyptian Revolution.
I connected with many other Libyans, in between and outside Libyens to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Golaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, young women and men were in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice to the air.
They proved some seminal courage by putting themselves against the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the far east west, all the way to the South.
Finally, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and overtake the tyranny.
But Gaddafi has left a great brush, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed tyrant regimes in both infrastructure and culture and moral structure of the pinkish society.
The devastation and the challenges, I deliberately renamed how many other women build the civil society of Lybia. We demanded a national and legitimate transition to democracy and national balance.
Oiving to 200 organizations, and right after the case, Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Libyters, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to enter the societic empowerment for women, and to our right judgment, to the right-makers of democracy and politics.
I met a very hard environment where I met, a very difficult environment, which was more polarized, a environment which was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and impairment.
I led a Department of Peace Movement to a CEO of Libery's women to get a head-by-payed law, a law that anyone, any attitude, no matter what context it should be to vote and do it, and to do it, mainly to address and to a political sector, a shift between women and women who are both on the horizontal and horizontal and horizontal and to make a complete impact.
At the end, our initiative was taken over and successfully succeeded.
Women won 17.5 percent of the national justice policy in the first elections since 52 years.
But quite frankly, the euphority of the elections and the entire revolution went up to the whole revolution, because every day we were taking on new messages of violence.
We woke up a morning to the extent of the holistic mosques and Sufi masters.
In another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and attack the message.
And then, on one other morning, the murder rate was signed up by the army.
And really, every day, we woke up under the tyranny of the military and their ongoing challenges against the rights of rights and their defenses of laws and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary state of mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, liberty, dignity, social justice -- which they had initially ended up with.
Intent, inclusion and revenge became the icon of the Fol newspaper of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you with the success story of our failed and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we, as a nation, have made false choices and the wrong choices.
We've misinterested our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security in Lybias.
Did the appropriate and the change between female and male candidates provide peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What is it?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate and dominate from selfish politics and dominance, both men and women?
Perhaps women weren't the only ones who missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gistade and the end.
Our society needs a national dialogue and specialization when it took the election, which has only strengthened the polarization and settlement.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it needs to have the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that not only claim value, but also compares it: forge, instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than counter-exiting.
These are the ideals that need a war broken lybacia to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in that alchemia, it's all about the interpening of feminine and masking views.
That's the real compliance.
And we have to do that in existential ways before we do it with sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," "The Lord of Good God, rall."
The word "raheem," again, which is known in all the latehamian traditions, has the same Arabic root as "mun," "in mother lowers" and symbolized the mother's maternal feminine who surrounds all of humanity, of the man and the female and the female and all the tribes have gone away.
And just like the mother's assaulting the embryo that grows in it, it's completely supplementing the basic body of compassion to the whole existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is going to include all the things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has preached from my dances."
Do we want to get the gi of the gistle out of the gist.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were recording the story of Kim Ilung, but we were not learning very much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although I was often wondering how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until all the time changing.
At the age of seven, I first saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family wasn't poor, and I've never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me, and my mother brought a letter from a colleague's sister.
It said, "If you were to put this thing, our five family members will not be on the planet because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
I walked past the station and I saw something horrible I can't delete from my memory.
There was a blind woman on the floor, and a carved kid in her arm looked helplessly in her mother's face.
But nobody helped them because everyone was busy doing it to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-1990s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were more than a victim of famine, and many more people survived because they ate grass and beetles and trees and garden synapses.
And the current has gotten more and more and more and more urgent, so at night, all the lights of China on the other side of the user that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there and we didn't.
This is a satellite view of North Korea and its neighbors at night.
This is the ambship, which is partly used as part of North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river is very illuminating and enabled North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of die.
Sometimes I saw the bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that, while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the far-to-up relatives.
I just thought I would be apart for a short time from my family.
I would have never thought it would take me 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl with no family.
I had no idea what life would be like North Carolina refugees, but I realized soon it's not only incredibly difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Carolina's refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a horrible destiny of North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare room was perceived when I was caught by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be North Koreans, so they tested my Chinese habits and asked me countless questions.
I was afraid, I thought I would explode my heart.
If anything is unnatural, I could be locked and signed up.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the survey, a senior officer said to the other, "That was a falcet.
She's not a North Korean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are found in foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught in the Chinese police and are arrested.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they eventually released out because of massive international pressure.
These North Koreans were not very lucky.
Every year, hundreds of North Koreans are caught in China and are arrested by North Korea, where they were tortured, locked or publicly executed.
Even though I had the privilege of being out of my heart, there's not much of the other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and struggle hard to survive.
After she got a new language and found a new language, her world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea and again I started a new life.
I am in South Korea, I was able to abandon myself as a greater challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I've seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very divergent because of 67 years of sharing.
I went through an identity crisis.
Am I or North Canal?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although my own self-interest was not falling into the south Korean life, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording examination at the university.
Just when I was treated on my new life, I got a shock call.
The North Carolina government started taking out the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to be moved around, to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to take an incredible route back to the path of freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took myself back to the north Canal border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to lead them to more than 2,000 miles through China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride took a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was held on, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the experiment and started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official called my family, I stood up and said they were gay, and I was her boss, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but fortunately, he believed me.
We managed to go to the la lavope border, but I had to almost every one of my money to look at the border routes of Laos.
But even after we'd crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money sentence and bribes, my family was released in a month, but shortly, my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest disincessions of my life.
I had done everything I could to protect my family for freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Geographic message.
I went and I went to between the immigration agency and the police department, and I was trying to clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay back bribes or money supplies.
I lost all my hopes.
And I was wondering the voice of a man, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger was taking care of it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without refusing to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And so I thank him about my heart and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not going to hire you," he answered.
"I help the North Korean people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger for me has been symbolized for a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom to get there is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start with little money or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea change from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I want to make hope to succeed North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I just have one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares it with discomfort, and he dislocited it.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the color of the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to remember words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate chefs, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the very first episode of the teubbies on my arm had turned to my arm and Lady and Gagas's birthday.
Don't listen to them, don't they stop?
But a lot of people don't vote.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that although this was the case, even though they were not used to be normal, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that influence social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's different in each individual, and it's very different, and so Remi is different than Sam.
And the world is, every 20 minutes, when a new person is diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the fastest growing development disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've encountered autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very, very angry.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a room where the washing machine was hidden and eating everything that was coming under it.
And as he got older, he became different and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustles and the never ending hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had otherwise lied.
Remarkably.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wish were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love, and I understand that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Now, normality is the beauty that makes us differences, and the fact that we are different, it doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like, you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, in our own, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each one of us has a gift in it, and all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifices of potential.
The chance of scale, progress and change is dying in the moment we try to be like someone else.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with awe and curiosity, with this picture on a project that he took an apple and then through a half-th-century version of the air.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-Aid photography, a new reconstruction technique that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build the cameras that are going to look out the way we view the corners, or we can't see an <unk>-ray in our body and really ask the question of what we mean with "Mamera" in our body.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I cut it in a billionth of a second -- these are several Temtoseconds -- I create a package of photons that hardly a millimeter wide, and this photon package will move this project, move to speed, speed speed, and, as I said, a million times faster than a brand.
So if you take this project, take this satellite package and shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What is the time-surface of light?
So this whole event, this whole event.
So, think about what the whole event is actually taking less than a nanotone -- so long as the light needs to go back this lane -- but I slowed down this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund that research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon pack that starts moving through through and then breaks in the inside.
Part of the light is flowing out to the table outside, and you see the spread of waves.
Many of the photons eventually reach the trigger of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spreading out on the table and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on the end of the bottle after some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back the same route and slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring movie -- from a slow, normal projectal movement.
And what about a little still-lapse photograph?
You can see again, these waves are streaming around the table, streaming around the Tom Islands and flipping the wall in the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature is drawing a photo like this, each of which is a femto image, but of course our eye is formed together.
But if you look at this Tom Pilads, you'll see that if the lights turn over the Tom Rover, they're going to keep the dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom Rover is turned on and the light is going around you and it comes back after a few hundred and a half seconds.
So in the future, if this Temto camera is built in your camera in your camera, it could be possible that you could go into a supermarket and find out if it's a fruit, if it's a fruit, if it's not to touch it at all.
So how did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of the long air time, you have very little light, but we add a billion times faster than your shortest ventilation time, so you don't get as good as you get.
So what we do is we send this project, this satellite package, a million times, and we use it again, and we use very clever synchronization, and we combine these gigabytes of data to make these Rovers that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things with it.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputers: To see corners?
The idea is that we light on the door.
It's going to be deflated, walk into the room, bounces back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these more magnification of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it already.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is hidden in a soup, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper in the Nature Communications, it was released by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to shrink that light project, and they're going to push it on this wall, and this photons package will be dragged back into all directions, and some of the photons will get our hidden soup, which will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, and they'll all be slightly different, slightly different, but they'll be able to get
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capabilities.
It has a very good time-consuming solution, and it can look at the world at light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is, what's left.
So by taking a laser and turning it up, we can take a raw image that looks like you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but if we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and put them together, and try to analyze the different light textures, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit more work to do that before we can actually implement this from the lab to practice, we could build cars that are preventing collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can use them to search on dangerous injury by looking at light that is being reflected through open windows, or we can build endosak on the body, see the pelcrosula and also seepopes of paste.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is very challenging, which is why this is really a term for scientists to think about Femto imaging, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like at Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collect every single time, not only the scientific imaging process, we can also create a new form of computer photography with paint and paint paint and time-thrades, and we can only forget about these waves between time.
But it also happens in some fun way too.
If you look at the waves under the bottleneck, you can see the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
And it turns out that because we've almost got light speed speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
The sequence that happens in the world, in the world, is appearing in a more mature order, so by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether it's possible for photography around corners or to create a new imaging tool for medicine or new forms of art, since we've been able to open all the data and detail on our website and hope that the trusters, the creative and the research community, we're supposed to stop showing us that we should stop making the megapixs, to start to fix the next box and to the next camera.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with humans.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that a lot of educational efforts don't get passed through, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and tiltons and circles.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we divide our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the vacant homes so that our communities reflect our desires and our dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is distracted by the huge estress that has been defending loved ones for hundreds of years, drunk and junior shirts. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever fails, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned feet of America.
I live near this house thinking about how I can feed it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've thought a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratitude for my life, and it brought me very clear about the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to keep that view on the ground every day.
It's easy to lose your life at a moment and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote with a treasure of the blankets: "If I die, I want to be," I want everybody to take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it kept growing.
I want to share with you some sentences written on the wall by the people.
"You know, I'm going to die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Only I die, I want to be on a broad-time conclusion about the International World Cup."
"Wait to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"On I die, I want to plant a tree."
"Only I die, I want to live undercover."
"Wait me to die, I want to keep them in my arms again."
"Only I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."
"I want to die." I want to be all myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to comfort me during the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for the first, thinking, remembering what's most important as we grow and changing.
I did this last year and got hundreds of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a building kit in countries like Kazanhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the chance to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We often are being kept on talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I have come to realize that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthens us the most.
And the idea of death is how we think life is so much.
Our common spaces are best showing us what's important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people around us can not only help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in making math. A special problem for anyone who's engaged in targeted mathematics is that we're like business leaders.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
And so today I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
And dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're excited at the sight of the master Ballett and the waving, as you're going to see.
For a ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental position of propulsion that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it with my fellow fellow fellow named Janriides, who was a ballet-death.
Over the years, you've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the indelable symptoms like weakness, semen, pearidity and others who cause this disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know if there's a cure, if we have an objective metric that can answer this question.
The trouble is that, for Parkinson's and other control disorders, there's no biomarkers, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's available is this 20-minute test for neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means, outside of clinical trials, it's never done. It's never been done.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a very expensive hospital service.
It costs 300 percent, by the way, to go into the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional approach that we try to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual receptions like me, Janriplem.
You see a video of the vibrating vocal sounds.
This is what happens in the healthy condition when someone is creating speech sounds. We can look at the mood of a soundshake dancer because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we make sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP2.
And like Ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk until it does.
And by the way, we can determine the position of vibrating mood, and like the limbs, the muscles are affected by Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of irregular vocal sounds on the lower record.
We see the same symptoms.
Ruminous, weakness, ealness.
The language will even be more mature and fuzzy, and that's an example of theymptom.
Now, the impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision, combined with a new machine-based learning that is now very advanced, we can now tell exactly where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the mood.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
And so little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are accurate. They're not going to do the right tests of experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very fast, they're going to take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something's extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large order.
And we can do these amazing goals with this.
We can reduce logistous problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do low-cost funds for clinical trials and allow them to be able to do the first one investigation of the entire population.
We now have the ability to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now, we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's voice development.
With an Aculab and PatientLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough output data for the success of these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call cheaply to leave images for a few cents, and I'll be familiar with pleasure that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples from, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who is not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to say, while the caller says, is there a person who suffers or doesn't, OK.
Some of them may not be able to get to the end.
But we collect a huge database in different circumstances, which is interesting, and these conditions are important because we are designed to exploit it to understand which ones are the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is accurate?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done such amazing work -- has shown that it also works on the cellular network, which allows this project to do, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That means people can -- people can call with the cell phone and call the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya in the south of the south of the Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Boston National Park is only in the South, it's encoded in the area. That means that wildlife like Zebras can leave the park anytime.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning and found them dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we were coming together with our animals and our wildlife habitats on the sky, and that's why our animals care so much.
Even as a child, I learned how to hate lions.
Our warrior, Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestry. They also have been set up because of this problem.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are only so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy is both responsible for his father's cows, and so it was my father's been.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Bears fear for fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept going.
I had a second idea. I tried it with a bird's.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they look at the bird search and they go again. The next time, but they come and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach and kill our livestock.
I stopped the storing one night. I walked around with a torch around him, and this time the lions didn't interrupt.
So lions fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
Even as a young boy, I worked in my room all day and once again I took the new radio of my mother, and the day, she almost took me all the time. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a right-handed drive from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It blinks.
And I turned on a switch to turn the lights off and turn on.
This is a little pear of pears out of a broken flaphlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is actually putting the battery, which is providing current power to the correct operating system. I call it a transformer.
And the right is to blink in.
You see that the pearls are pointing outwards, because from there, the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions think I'm going around the rubble, and I've been in bed all the time.
Thank you.
So I've been back in our homes, and since then we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used across Kenya, including other predators like hygiene or leops, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants remotely from farms.
My invention helped me to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps fundraising and education through donations and education.
I even brought my friends home and I put the lights in there, and together we install the lights where there's no one left, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
A year ago, I only took a boy from the savanna who was dressed cows, and I looked at planes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in a one of the other day!"
And I'm standing here now.
I was given to a plane, I was invited to my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a airplane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to eat lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can share it together, side by side with lions, without argument.
Ash<unk><unk>n<unk>n. In my language, that means this: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yeah.
You work on other electrical innovations.
What's next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I work on an electric fence. A electrode electrical fence?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it once, right -- yeah, I've tried it again, but I've given the attempt because I got a blow.
First of all, Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you every step of your boss, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, and I've got photography, but today I want to share with you with you 15 of my favorites, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no chance to shoot a picture again. Not even taking the lighting.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story started when I was a talk in New York, and my wife took this picture where I hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
And this is exactly a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided we were going to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this goes from ...
When my daughter's third birthday came closer, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York and do it to a father-in-law race to continue the ritual?"
So we started asking, by the time, to go through the street tours, to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to take a complete stranger and you're going to have a camera.
No one ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been touched with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred to us.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11 and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a snapshot moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to stay in October a week, to stop time and change our time and how we change the year from year to year, not only physically, but in all to reflect.
Because whenever we do the same picture, our view changes from time to time, as it always reaches new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how it interacts with everything it looks like and how it sees.
This very intense time we spend on each other is something we value and expect every year.
Last year, while one of our trips, we went for a walk, and suddenly it remained as if they were fixed, it shows a red mark on a dollkin which they had learned as a little kid, at the previous travelings.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old, that moment she had taken care of.
She said she remembered her heart breaking out of her chest when she first saw the store for the first time nine years ago.
And now they look in New York for high schools because they really want to study in New York.
And I realized, obviously, the most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and don't you like to ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 26.69, 56.8/33.7/21.4/13.8 (BP=0.973, ration=0.973)
