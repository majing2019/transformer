When I was 11 years old, I was drawn by the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the day.
My father stopped watching his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly covering the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"Now, you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban did the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned to go to school.
So I was committing for five years as a boy and I was committing my older sister who couldn't have been able to be on a secret school.
Only we could go to school.
We took a different way to see where we went.
We were in our hidden books in aquarium so it looked like we were going to go buy.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was a nice one in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over and over again, the class suddenly had to come out for a week, because the Taliban had been swallowed.
We'd never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are they going to win us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a great fortune to grow up in a family where education was important and were valued and valued daughters.
My grandfather had been ahead of his time.
On a foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreignist, and he was about sending his daughter -- my mother -- and turned out to school and turned out to be a father's father.
But my mother was trained as a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to the retirement, just to transform our house to a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father, here, to see -- was the first person in his family ever received a school.
And it was always clear that his kids would receive an education, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of sending his kids to school.
I still know that I was frustrated in the Taliban in the years, sometimes, from our lives, from the endless fear and the interstellation of the interconability.
I had good love to give up. But my father said, "Toy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be transported from your house.
But you're always going to stay in the world, which is inside of this, and even if we have to pay our blood for your lunch, we're going to do that.
So -- you want to give me more and more?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was broken by decades of war.
Less than 6 percent of my age women have a higher degree as a masterry degree, and if my family didn't have been used so much to be used to my education, I would be one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proud formerly unrain of the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who gave me interest.
He's not just about the school degree, but also to be the first woman and I was the first woman who runs him with the car through Kabul.
My family believes to me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for education for women.
So I helped build wireless, and maybe the only board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school training is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to perceive the potential.
And see how their parents and fathers are facing for them, as I was, despite all the time, and against all the events that were happening.
So like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was on the home home of SOLA in her village, and they're the death of a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rings, and a voice was thrown on him, if he was sending his daughter to school, they would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to let me now, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter on the game because of your old and over-of-the-day ideas."
In terms of Afghanistan, I realized something that is often being swallowed in the West: The one of us who have success, is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realized that their success is also succeeding.
It's not to be hot that our mothers are not going to be able to play a critical role in our success.
They're often the ones that are very, very compelling and compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And the Taliban were only about a few hundred-dollar girls at school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are beating the school bank.
Afghanistan seems like America is looking like this.
Americans recognize how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-term and they're changing with the United States's stock group.
But if I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them who encourage them, I see a very promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is for me a country of hope and the unfinished possibility, and I remember the girls who visit SOLA every day.
and like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do is I do, including a living life -- was characterized by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977 -- I see young, but I'm not -- I've been in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working with the engineering collaboration with African countries.
I've worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we're an Italian good person and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we first measured.
Our first project, which is my first book of "Ripples of Zambezi," was one of the things we used to show the people of Sambica, how food is built.
We came up with Italian forest in South Zambia, and we got this crazy valley, which leads to Sambes's River, and we trained the local population of Asian tomatoatoes and to Rechini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such waste-free agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Pade time to save the people of Sambique before the star."
Of course, all of this wonderful in Africa.
We had these super-great-great-filled tomatoatoes. In Italy, they became so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it and said the Toramb, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, about 200 palleys of the river and all the water-suppled.
We said to the Toramb, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why did you not tell us that?" You never asked us."
I just thought we were so great as Italian in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans did, what the French world did, and after I saw what they did, I was pretty proudly proud of our project in Zambia.
We at least put the nilper.
You should be able to see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we haven't called the world's never-envented African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a post-the-the-the-profit economist.
The book was published in 2009, in 1991.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read their book.
You read from a African woman, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, imperialists, missionists, and there are only two species we deal with people. We're propolis them, or we're patriarchical.
Both words come from the Latin Asian root, which means "Vater".
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture, as if they were my children. I love you so much."
Patronisis: I treat every other culture, as if they were my servant.
So white people in Africa are called "bux," the boss.
I was a kid who was a little bit embarrassed when I read the book "mall" by singing. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, then they leave them in quiet.
That should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of help is respect.
So tomorrow, the gentleman who opened this conference, he put a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolial?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people and create a system called business relief, which never gets motivated, but you will be motivated to be the service of the local talent, the local man, the dream of the local people, the dream of being a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never achieve a community with ideas, you get yourself together with a local home.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipen.
We have no infrastructure.
We're going to close friends and we're going to find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing of humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
And it may not be the person with the idea, but it's available.
I had a case of this, many years ago, why not to get to a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in a community.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
They never participate in and they will never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
So planning has this blink.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We work on one to do this, we need to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the home minister of the business, the local hospital of the operating room with you in your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the tools to change your passion in a way of changing life.
I tried this in sectional, West Australia, trying to do this.
I tried to take care of the time and tried to escape the flushy, where we tell others what to do.
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and within the first three days, my first clients, and I helped him, and he was a fish in a garage, he was Maii, and I helped him to get a restaurant in a restaurant and to organize the fishermen, and they said, "You've helped us help the Maori?"
I helped these five fishs work together and they didn't sell a factory in Albany for 60 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars in S<unk>Kilo, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us help us?"
I had a year, and I had 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "What are you doing?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I hear them listen."
So -- so the government says, "Are you going to get it again."
We've made it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the creation of the world.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on in loneliness.
Peter printer, one of the best business workers of history, died with 96 years ago.
So Peter's printing professor, before he was involved with companies, and Peter said that the printer said, "Make is really incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death penalty of the entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchel to know what the smartest man Christchet wants to do with her money and their energy.
You need to learn how to get that to get you to one.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get caught.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
What's most cheated about what's most of you doing tonight?
You're laughing, you're passionate people. You've been coubling.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the causal fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
Automatic motor engine is not sustainable.
The re-arting species of reform is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways to cure, build, transport, and can turn them into the world.
The technologies are not there.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget!
The government? Remember it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to publish the future of the city of New York in 1860.
In 1860, they came together and they were able to form up what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a holistic: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows in this pace, they needed six million horses to get people to get people, and it would be impossible to get the dung of six million horses.
Because they were already in the dung.
and they look at the dirty technology that makes life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology, the race had made. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Deard, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to be offered by discourse.
They don't come and talk to you.
So next, you have to provide them absolute, committed, passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, they need to be able to do three things: to be the product that needs to be grand, the market market needs to be great, and the financial agency has to be enormous.
So guess what?
We never met a single person that can produce something at the same time, sell and care about the money.
That's not something that happens.
This person was never born.
We ran research and we looked at the 100 idiinal companies in the world -- Carnegie Wdohouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that has all successful companies in the world, only one thing that was founded: no only one person.
Now we teach 16 teenagearians in North Korea, and we start teaching them to give the first two pages of Richard Bransographic Autobiography. The task is 163 is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransographic, often like the word "the" and often used the word "tood"
Never even "I" and 32 times "we".
He wasn't alone when he started.
No one started a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who have a small manager of managers sitting in cafes and Bars, who will be a committed buddy who has done for them, what someone of this gentleman who speaks about this poet, and someone tells you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do it." Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate leadership in helping them find the tools and people, and we found that the wonder of the local population can change the culture and the economy of this community, just by the actual passion and the power of their imagination.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned what it needs to be like to be Alice in miracles.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communications -- asking engineers to divide in communication.
I was afraid -- I was afraid.
Fear with these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, not trusted words.
But when the conversation evolved, it turned me to see Alice when she was driving down the mouse, and a door to a new world.
And I felt like I was doing conversations with students. I was amazed to think about the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this wonderland.
I think to open up this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers, the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to be progress. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religistist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to join us in their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please sit up with us.
I want to show you a few approaches, as you can do it, we can see that the science and the technology that you're busy with you, sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, yeah, and what?
So why is it so relevant to your scientific field for us?
It's not just that your grandchildren study, but it tells us that their grandchildren, the antennae, the antennahing structure in our bones, because it's important to learn and to treat oopalides and treat.
And when you describe what you do, then the preventable dictionaries.
In arguments, there's a barrier to the understanding of your thoughts.
And I'd sure you could use your "H" and time and time, but why don't you just say "Space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're not going to be able to make your idea of thinking, it's not the same as your level of view.
As Einstein said, "Tait things as easy as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with tradeoffs.
and there are some things about this: examples, stories and analogies. And in this way, you can pull us into your bann.
And when you put your work on it, then you take the dots away.
Have you ever asked you, why is it called the "deception point?"
What happens when someone gets to look at it? Another one is just about to be weeks, and with those dots, the first one is your audience.
It's not just boring, but it also fits too much to the talkal part of our brain, and by doing so, we're rapidly challenged.
This example, of Gene Lindby Brown, is a lot of powerful, and it shows that the special structure of the limb is so stable, that they were actually the inspiration of the unique design of the Eiffel.
The trick here, to use a single, simple sentence where the audience is going to lose the lens, to counteract the lens, to optimize images and graphics that also enable our other senses and to make a deeper sense of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up these door and see the wonders land that makes science and technology happen.
And because the engineers I taught me to make up with the <unk>Nerdite contact in me, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
So look at your science and your paper points, and you divide through the relevance, and the audience says, what's important, and multiply with your passion that you have for your incredible work, and that is what you can do with your incredible work. And that is that there are some possible interactions that are full-scale interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was necessarily forced to be.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my phone.
and a cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can take a phone phone and start a postage in Egypt.
And you can take a phone phone, you can take a song, you can get it on soundscreen and be famous.
So that's possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city in time.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and showed them.
We were in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were coming from and demanding the change, had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phone up, keep it up!
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
They're a lot. Almost every one has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and my phone about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines of information.
Data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.R. has set up a right line.
So this line is called the right line of the stock control chain.
And that line says that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service worker in Europe, has to store a range of users of Benetvet information.
Who is calling? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is stored at least six months, two years from your phone company, or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this plan-based supply.
We want self-suffors in digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who said, "We don't want to."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin and said, "Food not fear."
And even some people said that could become the Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headblolisti in easternland.
And I also wondered, is it really working?
Can all of this information really store us?
Every time I use my phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Dice Telegraph, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send all the information that you saved me over me.
And I asked them, and she said, "You couldn't get a right answer. Only little Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's happening with your catalog.
So I decided to put a court process against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Difth Tele-Axis said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to take back the tag, which is what they all want to send me to the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of E.U.E. is the ultimate law of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown turn with a CD.
And on the CD, that was what it was.
35 and830 lines of information.
So first I saw it and said to me, well, it's a giant file. My hand.
But then I realized that this is my life.
That's six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I do with this?
Because you can see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is protective control.
So with time and online data and open cities, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see how I drive Frankurturt with the train to get the oil, and how many calls I do on the road.
And that's possible by this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me and they call me each other.
And after a while, you call them up and you call them, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, which is the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the Germany had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi knew who was in the demonstration, and if the deer had known who was the leader, then that might never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall, maybe it wouldn't have happened.
And then, not the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today's national agencies and companies want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and open.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it all the way long.
But self-confidence and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-confidence today.
They have to fight for this every day.
So if you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you're going to tell yourself, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, do your phone company on the information that you've stored over you?
So, in the future, every time you use your phone, remember you have to fight your self-esteem in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the body-based, rapid-dwell, Brak.
So the city plan is coming and they thought about changing the name of South Central Central so that it changes it for something else, South Los Angeles, as if something changes in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
These same-trinded, rapid-diving restaurants, bureaucratic spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert of South Central Central Los Angeles, the home of Drivechus and the Drivebys.
The cometic is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Driveyys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the sacred diseases.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than it's at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even stand with that.
And I wondered, how would you feel like if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of your house, you see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood.
I could make sure that the ceiling is bought and sold like use plant routes.
I see dialogue centers going up and down like Starbucks.
And I realized that this must stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I had no excuse me to get a apple that is not medial.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park plant.
It's 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the position.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Growers, and we started to plant my food hot, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a stock group, and we're together with the gardeners from all the social layers and from all the city, and it's totally voluntary and all we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone is worried about it.
The city came to me and he basically shared me a carrier, and said I had to remove my garden, which became a legitimate configuration.
And I thought, "Yeah, yeah?
It's a narrative of how we grow food from a piece of land that is totally not true for you?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city bank and with a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on Change.org, and with 900 regulations, we succeeded.
We thought we were in the hands of victory.
And even as a city called me and said they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why should they not do that?
L.A. has the most cavits in the United States.
They have 67 kilometers in Brackm.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million factory plants.
Why the hell should they not find that okay?
and by the growing plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my work producer, I tell people that they should be going to grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing their own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I tend to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti work. I'm going to plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who is running through the walls, I'm going to break up the lawn and the park.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my most compelling thing for this stuff.
They would be surprised to use what the ground is, if you can use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine what's amazing is a sunflower, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was going to become an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
They would be wondering how kids are going to be influenced by it.
and the most powerful act of therapeutic and cool act that you can do, especially in the city.
You get strawberry straws.
I remember when these mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked at them like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
It's not the end of the street without reason."
I was annoying when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just forced me to do this, and people asked me, "Foney, you don't fear that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid they're going to be cool.
It's about it on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
And at a different time, I put a garden in this homeless garden in Dublin L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to set up the carrier.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how they planted them with their mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even if it changed, even for a moment.
Green Grals have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had these 50 people coming and we did it, and they're all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoatoes, they eat tomatoatoes.
But if they don't get anything from it, if they don't show how food and body influence, they blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put in this thing -- I see color kids who are exactly on the path that they were, and they don't do anything.
I see the garden gardeners as an opportunity to train these kids to care about their communities to lead a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we will never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole area of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ships and turn them into healthy cafe.
So you don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snatch because free is not sustainable.
The comry of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and children from the streets, and they enjoy the joy and the pride and honor of creating their own food, and if you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gang, toilet-hirts.
We need to turn the picture of the gang.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gang.
You're going to become a mugch, right?
And let's take the gun to your vote.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you want to sit in smart chairs and want to make a meeting where you talk about it, any time.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skate, in my garden so we can plant any flush.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnnolly monaster."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And they're "nnnolly monaster" means "the unhealthy politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher is a better definition: "A Snolly, someone who is a office, independent side, or program, or its success, and its success of the pure power of the existential determination."
I have no idea what's the toy name.
In other words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So, 1771, for example, were reported by the British parliament, newspapers not the exact word "wreating" in the debut.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went to the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower in London and gave him a hand, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to stop, and then finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so" is very strong as Brass."
And then the word is on the English word for the wheel.
But it's not true. It's going back to a prisoner's free-pord of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are interacted, I want to take you with the United States, at the time they've just reached independence.
You were looking at the question of how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
They didn't know.
So what's called the leader of a universal nation?
and it has been misdiagnosed in Congress for a long time.
And there were all kinds of robotic suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his highness of George Washington, and again, the other, the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's not that kind of a visceral way.
Some people wanted to call him king.
They thought that was a good way of being.
They weren't monarchistic, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have been worked.
But everyone was a little bit bored because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the bookbook of a primeman who constantly writes, "I've been able to do the same issue."
The reason for the time of the waist and the long-term was that the assembly house was against the Senate.
They didn't want to be a celebrity at the time that Washington was going to be a good job. They didn't want to.
And the king call it, and maybe it may be on ideas for its results.
They wanted him to give him the most humest, most of the most horrifous titles that they thought.
This title was called "Pory."
President, they didn't invent the title. He had happened. But it only meant that someone was running a collection.
It's like a pre-war attack.
He didn't have the size of the term "The Prays" or "wug water."
Sometimes there were little civil war-based and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
So the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "It's ridiculous, you can't call him president.
This guy has to be signed and signed up foreign carriers.
Who will take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like the President of America?"
And also after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't have a conversation.
Instead, it's not a game that we should use the word "sictor," but they wanted to be totally aware of it because of their honest respect for the opinions and the institutions of civil nations, whether it's in the Republic of Monarchy, where it's the state of the state of the state of the state of the state, not necessarily the foreignity of the United States, and the other people who were not agreed to be responsible to be the foreignity of
You can learn three interesting things.
First, and that's what I find the best, until now, I can't figure out if the Senate ever confirmed the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just been a welcoming name. He just waited for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says that something temporary is -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, and that's the most important point, is that the title of America today is not more so humbling, right?
That has something more than 5,000 nucleic swamps that he has and the biggest economy in the world and a flan of drones and all this stuff.
and the story has given the size of the title.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They get an respected title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the counter-contite of self-esteem -- well, it was like that.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear swamps and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost, because no one feels very humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away, and I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the things that I can do.
Politicians are trying to design words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality more than words can ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came up in a truck with about 50 engines in fighting with the stigma of Walalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers from Jacksonville, Florida.
I would like to be my black Conclips against a pair of brown leather and swopping a rocket in the outside of the government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had been big with war, but next to Pyjama party and football games and committing with a racist South America and diadic protesters who live with the non-governmentalism and Afghanistan and the courtship of Afghanistan and the events that I knew what I knew.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm here today, I'm a mangrown, South African-state, from God Gnades, and a radical political artist who lived the last nine years in Afghanistan and created.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rain-like paint. I want to make art that compelled and challenge authority and re-inform reality and re-exventing the physical spirit of the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihad -- which is about jihad against communists like "Pople" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can do jihad-deeking as the parliament should pay for a job and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Do I do jihad and I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to allow these Mafiosi to escape themselves as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan with a project called "Rapes," where you give yourself a policeman, build a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money from them, providing money and feeding money in Kabul, and the police police police in Kabul, and they hope that they will give us 100 percent of them to give us the people to believe that they will be safe.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become considered after the Interconce conflict.
The war and the foreign views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion training for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was able to build the garden of local indigenous peoples with a protective and a variety of different segregate or a non-hilled, or a non-Curpired,
And I'd like to see what a simple taper from Kabul between 18 minutes of Appel's app to create a dialogue about creating the development of developing European rituals in the past-war rhetoric of the White Man, to protect the brown man and even even a little bit of their civil society.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misdirected.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self needs it.
So what's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, exactly, I said.
I felt like I was building a very unfinished tension in the room, because I shouldn't have that dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit of a change with it.
This is the first time someone walks up on the TED stage, so you can appreciate the lucky thing to see.
If some women were really washing up when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read on Twitter.
I also think that I'm pretty privileged because I can change in very short seconds, which you think you're thinking about.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
They're very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to move the sweater above my head, because you're all going to wake up, so you're going to do nothing, as long as it's on my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it wasn't that helpful to be as embarrassing as this picture.
It's a picture of a powerful, but it's a picture of the surface.
I've just changed your mind in six seconds.
And on this picture -- I never really had a friend's friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back-lunk and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgeries or the wrong wires I spent two days ago trying to work, there's very few ways to change our expressions, and our expressions -- even though it's supersturiable -- it's a big impact on our lives.
To be fear is to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be a model?"
I say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and a critical legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is made.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as healthy and young and interactive in the awe of the revelation that we're programmed, but also as big, feminine and bright-down.
And it was created for me, and it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionist calls, "Har, Naie, Tyan, Joan Smane. Liu.
And first, I'm comment on your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modules that were counted every single, and that 677 megelels were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that I'm always asked to be, is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I said, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the creator of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which would be totally wrong, because you're the first one."
If they're still saying, "No, Cameron, I want to become a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have responsibility for nothing, and you could be the President of American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
And to say that later, you want to become a model, it's like you're going to say that you want to get the Jacket in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a project-based model, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be extended.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo on the run," and then, you know, the leg, and it's a long, and it's a left, and you just move back to the head, and you just go back to the back of the hand, and you see 300 times your friends, and you want to come back to your
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened.
If you finished school and did a lot of jobs, you can't say a lot more, and if you want to be president of the United States, but in your life, "10 years of underwear," you'll be looking at a little bit weird.
The next question that I'm often asked is, "Who is all the photos going to be stored?"
And yes, it's pretty much like all the photos being stored, but it's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I made, and that was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be very personal, but I was a young girl.
I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
That's me the day of the clock.
I had to join my girlfriend.
I'm at a Pyjama party, a few days before a Sharting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the New magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstyline and Makeup and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the evaluation. They're not me.
Okay, next question, people always ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-m-m-match shoes that I can never wear, but the things I get free are things that I love in real life and don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store, and I had forgotten my money, and you had the dress for free.
So as a teenager, I went to my friend, and I was a terrible driver, and she was left with a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took a -- "Soucuse, Mr. Grandw. and then we could go on.
I got these costless things because of my appearance and not because of my personality, and there are people who are paying attention to their appearance and not because of their personality, they pay a high price.
I live in New York and from 140,000 teenage camps who were stopped and shot over the last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It lives in New York, only 177 young young men and Latino, who doesn't ask the question, "Who am I going to stop?"
But, "How often am I going to stop? When am I going to quit?"
I found out that in my research, 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls don't like their body, and that number goes up to 78 percent if they got 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit thin and glowing hair, you feel very happy and fabulous."
And then we give a answer that might convey this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel, and it's great, creative, passionate people, passionate people."
All of that is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never told the camera, which I never said before, is, "I feel safe."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had little legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet a few modules, because they have the thin legs and the most beautiful hair and the cool rubber and they're probably because of their appearance of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I prepared this talk, it seemed very difficult to get me to get a more honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to get here and say, "I got all the benefits of a pile that I got to be forced to be in my favor." And it doesn't feel good at all, and it doesn't always feel happy to make me happy."
It was very difficult to open up a legacy of oppression against gender and race when I'm one of the biggest users.
But I'm happy, and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great to be here before 10 or 20 years, and my career has been more fulfilled, because I would not say what I would get my first job, or maybe I would say, I wasn't paid to be a college, which is so important.
So if you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our mad-and-reemcession and misfortful.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, Gaddafi's resistance. Give it a fight.
But I will never be a little bit like a Gaddafi revolution."
There are almost two years since the Norwegian revolution, inspired by the waves of mass destruction and both in the Egyptian revolution.
I joined with many other Libyes and outside of the rally to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gacis.
And it was there, it was a big revolution.
Young, gay women and men stood in the first row, and they asked the end of the regime, and Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved to prove out that they were asked to have the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They have shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east to the distant west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 dead deaths, it made us free our country and to break the tyranny.
Gaddi left a big criminal, a legacy of tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the course of the course of the course of the process.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's tyrannia has both the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The destruction and the challenges, I rented as many other women who are building civil society, Lyu<unk>u, and we asked a re-forfined transition to democracy and national.
OUUC: and they were launched in 200 organizations, and immediately after the case Gaddafis founded in Benghaz, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lyb, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to organize human development and leadership skills.
And with a wonderful group of women, I founded the peacebuilding platform of Dany women, a movement of women, leaders of different lives, whose goal is to engage public science for women's sociological empowerment and to our right-being in government and justice development.
I met a very difficult environment, a environment that was increasingly reinforced by the most powerful, a environment that was characterized by selfish politics of dominance and determination.
I led a initiative to the peace platform of homyders to achieve a corporate law, a law that every citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to vote for the right and at all, to address the political parties between a female and female and a female in the horizontal level and a constant level of the ability to make a decision-by-step and make a decision-by-step.
and we were taken to be taken in our initiative and successful.
Women won 95 percent of the nationwide elections in the first elections since 52 years.
But long, the euphoria of elections and the entire revolution went to the whole revolution every day, we went to new news against violence.
We were going to take a look at the work of ancient mosques and Sufi songs.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, again, another morning, the victim of police were executed by the army.
And really every day, we were at the tyrant of the military and their ongoing authorities against the human warrior and their preferences of laws and laws of laws.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and removed from the ideals and principles, dignity, social justice, social justice, which they were at the beginning.
Consolerance, decency and revenge became the icons of the <unk>Folime of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our success and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that we have a nation that has the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We set up our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security in Lybia.
Have the re-incession and the change between female and male rights led to peace and national reconciliation?
No, it didn't.
So what is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics and determination, both men and women as women?
Maybe the women weren't the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Galtade and the unfinished.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a transformational development as it took the elections, which is only the polarization and the fragility of the process.
Our society needs the intermedational embodiment of the woman as they need the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the woman.
We need to stop acting in the name of the anger and challenge a day of the powder.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that doesn't just cause the values, but also to fake, which is, instead of revenge, cooperation, cooperation, rather than competition, rather than counter-controlling.
These are the ideals that need a war-enated nose to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemie, and in this case, it's about the seduction of feminine and masks and masks.
That's the real balance.
And we need to do this in existential ways of doing it as a societic.
After a verse from the Koran, "I'm a god's word of Good God, rally."
The word "rawem" again, which is known in all the early seminal traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "mear" and symbolized the matal feminine, the whole humanity, the man and the female and the female and all the tribes and all have been all over.
And just like the mother's assaulting in his own, completely surrounding the basic posture of compassion to the entire existence.
So we've been told to say, "My Galtade is all about one."
So we told us, "My Gnade had been in front of my seminar."
We all want to be the Galtade of the Galtade.
Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
We're going to have the story of Kiml Ilung, but we didn't learn very much about the world, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And while I often wondered what the outside world is, I thought I would spend my life in North Korea until a whole change.
At seven years, I first saw a public route, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
I wasn't poor, and I had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a letter from the sister of a colleague.
And you said, "If you were looking at this, our five family members will not be on the world, because we hadn't eaten for two weeks.
We're all on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard about it for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And I went through the railroad station and looked at something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A flowery woman stood on the ground, and a blood-touch child in her arm glips helplessly in the face of his mother.
But no one helped them because they were all busy caring about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'0s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were the ones who were hungry, and many others have survived because they ate grass, and the beetle and the tree cortex.
And the power rates became more and more likely to be, so at night, it's all about me, except the lights of China on the other side of the user, where we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of AmMa, which is the part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very narrow, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies moving in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that as the devastating years of getting sent to the hunger of the dead relatives to China.
I just thought that for a short time, I would be separated by my family.
I would have never thought it needs 14 years to live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like to be the North Bronx refugees, but soon I learned that it's not just very difficult, but because North Carolina, North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny in North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was trapped by the Chinese police and brought into the police department.
Someone told me to be Northstorean, so they tested my Chinese events and gave me countless questions.
I had this fear, I thought I would explode my heart.
If there's something unnatural, I could be locked up and be insulted.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my feelings and answer questions.
After they finished the question, a lawyer said to the other, "This was a fake.
It's not Northstansan."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China in foreign messages calledylyl, but many of them get caught by the Chinese police and signed up.
These girls were very lucky.
And while they got caught, they eventually were released because of tremendous international pressures.
These North Koreans, they didn't have so much luck.
Every year, North Koreans are caught in China and they are broadcasting up to North Korea, where they were tortured, or they were executed in public.
Although I was lucky at the end of my own, there's not a lot of North Koreans like that.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard survival.
and after they learned a new language and they found work, their world can be put in a moment on their head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was a major challenge to leave myself in Southern Korea, and I thought it was a bigger challenge than I thought.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very different from each other, because of 67 years of the part of the part.
I went through a identity crisis.
Am I the South or Northstorean?
Where come I? Who am I?
There was no land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the southern Korean life didn't get easy, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording interview at the university.
Just as I was more committed to my new life, I got a sad call.
The North Bronx administration started to take the money I sent to my family, and as a punishment became forced to move my family into a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to be able to bring back a tremendous route to the freedom of the path.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me go back to the north-Kat border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to lead them, to more than 2,000 miles through China and then to South Asia.
and we got almost thousands of times caught the bus drive.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the evidence of all, and started asking questions.
And I didn't understand that my family had a Chinese father, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese lawyer interviewed my family, I was determined to say that they were gay, and I was her senior staff.
He looked at me in denialful, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to get to the macro border, but I had to almost take my money to get the border routes of Laos to best be able to.
But even after we've gone through the border, my family was incarcerated, because of illegal border borders.
After I paid money and paid money, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was imprisoned, the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I had done everything to help my family to avoid freedom, and we were so close to it, but my family was arrested just before the south-Kathan message.
I went out and I went between the foreign agency and the police department, trying to clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay money to pay money or money to pay money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised to care about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained to my situation and without a rod, he went to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about the very heart, and I said, "Why are you going to help me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Bronx people help."
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous foreign stranger, for me, designed a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of international community as the hope of the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I've been united in South Korea, but the freedom is only a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they come to a new country, they start with little or no money.
The international community can help us learn in education, the English learning, the education and a lot more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still stay in contact with family jobs, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea turn out.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to be more hopeful to achieve North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I have just one request today.
I'm not saying I'm normal.
So I want to show you my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be.
Remi knows what love is.
It shares them unconditionally, and it gives them a little bit of a lot of them.
It's not too stupid. It doesn't look at the skin color.
It doesn't care about religious differences and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he tries to think about words that I never remember, reminds me of a thing: How little we know about the minds and how wonderful the unknown.
Samuel's 16 is big. He's very good-looking.
It has absolutely a perfect memory.
It also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he'd stolen my chocolate hair, but he reminds himself of the paper year of every song on my iPod, conversations when he was four, while the first result of the teystet on my arm and Lady Gaga.
They don't listen to them?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds are not in the social version of normal, they're often over and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged and strengthed my soul was that, although they weren't considered it as usual, it could only mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with the term "folerance" -- it's a complex disorder of the brain that affect social communication, sometimes learning and physical abilities.
It's a different part of every individual, so Remi is different from a few different than Sam.
And all over the world, it's going to be found 20 minutes in a new person with autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing care disabilities in the world, there's no known cause or healing.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was joking a lot.
He didn't want to play what it was like to do with the other babies, and actually he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a room that would fit and eat everything that came out of it.
And as he got older, it became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the leaws and the never end of hyperactivity, something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human being who never had ever been otherwise broken.
Sarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of time I wish they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and love, and I understand that these are things that I would not want to compete against normality.
The normality of the beauty that gives us differences, and the fact that we're different, doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be like you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us has a gift in it, and all of us, honesty, is the ultimate vulnerability of normality, the ultimate sacrifices of potential.
On scale, progress and change will die in the moment in which we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
So Docon has filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo, with a machine that has been cut through a apple and with a mass-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-long-by-century.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto-A photographer, a new engineering technique that is so fast, that they can create the process of slow-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
And so we can build cameras that can look at the outside of our view, or can't look at the edges or see a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we call "mamera."
Now, if I take a laser back and turn it into a billionth of a second, and I can -- these are several-seconds -- I can make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter, and this photon package, this project will move in speed, and it's going to move in speed, and it's like a little bit faster than a single year.
So if you take this project, you take these photons of packs and you put it in this bottle, and you can see how these photons break into the bottle?
What's the point of light in time is slow?
So this event, this event.
So think that the whole event actually takes less than a nanotole -- it takes the light to get the back -- but I'm going to add this video to the order of 10 billion, so you can see the light in movement.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
Our project, our project, comes into the bottle with a photon pack that starts to move through and then break the inside.
and it turns out that the light is coming out of the table, and you see the explosion of the waves.
And eventually, many of the photons are able to reach the wheel and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that fits around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are all over the side, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back and take the same track back and slow the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you've got to sit here to see the movie?
Day day, a week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what does it look like with something still-time photography?
You can see again, like this waves on the table, the Tomons and the wall flips over the back of the back.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
And it looked like the nature of the picture was like a photo, each one-to-A-A-A-ey image, but of course our eye is a set of frames.
But if you look at this Tombrate, you will recognize that when the light is going to be swallowed by the Tom's, it's going to keep moving down. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom is left and the light jumps around in her and comes back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this tapto- camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible to go in a supermarket and find if a fruit is closed, without touching it at all.
So what did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as photographers, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short-time, you're very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your short-time, so you're going to get that little light.
So what we're doing is we're going to send this project, this photons, a million times, and we're drawing it back together with very clever synchronizing, and combine these gigabytes of data to make this data, and to create this particular video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and make very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future superhero, to see the edges?
The idea is that we can light on the door.
It's going to be cut up, and it's going to go into the room, and it's going to be reflected back into the door, and eventually it's going to turn back to the camera, and we can use these more extracellular modifications of the light.
And it's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera on the left.
And the wall is hidden in the wall, and we're going to break the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the Gust Movement, it was taken by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to break this light project and then they're going to be able to turn it into this wall, and these photons are all set up in the direction, and some of the photons will be able to move our hidden soup, and then then the door will reflect the bridge of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons, and then they'll get a tiny bit more interesting at the same time, but they're going to come back to the most
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
She has a very good time-effective and she can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance on the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is heard of.
So by taking a laser, we can take a pipe image, which is what they see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and then we try to analyze the different light-surface, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our evolution.
We have a lot of things to do before we can actually do this from the lab, we could build cars that can avoid collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous survivors, by looking for the light, or we can build the window, or we can build the end of the back-by-by-the-the-the-who, and the body's deep-hand body and the blue-hand box.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, and that's really a term for scientists to think about Femto photography, because it can actually solve a new visualization process of medical imaging problems.
So, like Docon, a scientist, even a scientist, has become a art, an aerial photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we collect every time, not only 21 billion of the scientific process, but we can create a new form of computer photography with the light, and we can see that light-s of time, and we can not even look at the time of the surface of the surface of the surface and even looking at us.
But it's also something fun about this.
So if you look at these waves under the bottles, you can see that the waves of us move away.
We should be able to move our way up.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've almost taken light-speed effects and Einstein would like to see this picture incredibly amazing.
The order that happens in the world, in the process, in the camera, appear to be in a more order, so by applying the relationship between space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether it's about photography around the edges, or whether it's a new visualization for medicine or new exhibits, since we've made all the data open up on our website and hope that the "Solakers, the creative community, the research community, we should stop to start to start to start to start to start the digital sequence, and the next pixel of the camera, and the next pixel of the camera, and the next pixel, and
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways of improving our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many of the deliberations don't get passed, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the past years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little, and celons and chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much renters pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying with each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for existing homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being crippled by the giant ephemity that has been served for hundreds of years, kitchen-towning shadows, and I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the remains of the world in America.
I live in the nearby and thought about how I can make it happen, and I also thought of something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about the things that I've been interested in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life in the daily lives and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giantboard and wrote with a wall of the gaps, and I'm hungry, and I want to live, I want everyone who can come up, and think about his life and their hopes of this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled and grew up.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
I'm hungry, I want to be accused of piracy."
I'm hungry, I want to stand on a full-time line on the International Newsline."
I wish I'd die, I want to sing for millions of people."
I'm going to die, I want to plant a tree."
I wish I'd die, I want to live in the web."
I wish I'd die, I want to keep them in my arms."
I wish I'd die, I want to be someone's cavial series."
I'm dead, I want to be myself."
and this neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and the wine and the hard time I ever met.
and it's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors and becoming a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating place for development and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I've received hundreds of content of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction network in countries like Kasananan, South Africa, Australia and elsewhere.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to cross our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world where there's more and more intense distractions than ever before, looking at things with the right view and thinking that life is short and sensitive.
We're often being judging to talk about death, or to think about it, but I realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that most strengthal us.
And the idea of death is that we're going to show ourselves life.
So our common places show what we are as individuals and as a community, and with more ways of sharing our hopes and stories, can help people around us not only help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in a more elaborate math, a special problem for anyone who is busy doing things like corporations.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to explain to you what I do today.
and dance is one of the most human activity.
We're joking in the face of a secret ball and a pier, as you're going to see.
For the ballett, there's an extraordinarily large amount of knowledge and abilities, and maybe a fundamental emission that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's speeded this extraordinary capacity, and it also makes me feel like Jan Abriosition, who was in his time a ballet memory.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
Yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer on this disease, and they have to live with the abusive symptom as weakness, weaknesses and others who are causing this disease, so we need objective skill to discover the disease before it was late.
We need to measure the progress, and ultimately the only way to really know if there's a cure, if we have an objective measure, that's the answer.
And trouble is that there's no biomarkive activity for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials will never do it. Never ever.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
So would that be a trained tour in the hospital, and what if patients could make this test yourself?
It wouldn't have a local hospital worker.
By the way, 300 percent of the way, is to look at the neurological unit.
So I want to suggest you a non-governmental method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in some sense, virtual, like my Janis Abriulation.
So you can see a video of the vibrant vocal lobet.
And this is what happens in the healthy state, when someone is creating a speech, we can look at ourselves as a fake ballwiry, because we need to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make the sound, and we all have the genes for that. Fox2.
And like ballet, it takes a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn it.
And by clicking, we can actually control the position of the vibrant vocal lobets, and like the limb is also affected by the vocal muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of the bottom record, and you can see an example of irregular vocal resonance.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
True, weakness, abissance.
The language is actually going to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more likely to be a little bit of an example of the same.
Now, this impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and external effects of software, combined with new machine learning that is now very advanced, so we can now see where someone is in a space between the disease and health of health, just because of the ball.
So how can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
It's very little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are exactly exactly exactly. They're not going to be done by experts.
So they can be done in their own own.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If you're a little bit cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
And we can now do this amazing goals.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
You don't have to have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through a broad observation.
We can do low-cost mass training for clinical trials, and first of all, we can be able to do a study of the entire population.
We have now the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now we're going to start to start to start the first step in this direction, and we're going to start to start the Parkinson's disease-based.
With Aose and patient's DayMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the mission to provide these goals.
We have reputation numbers that are available for three-quarters of a billion people on the planet.
Everyone, with no Parkinson's disease, can call cheaply, to leave a few cents, and I'm afraid that we've already reached six percent of our target in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we're going to take 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who's not?
So what are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to tell the patient that the person has to be suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them will not be done until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions matter, because we are, to set up these, to see what the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy has happened?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make it amazing work, because he has shown that it works on the mobile network, which is what this project is capable of, and we're 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means that people can call -- people can call a phone phone and they could call the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, their voice, so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just in the South, and that means that wildlife can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of our cows who was killed in the night. I woke up in the morning and found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only Buipper.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we were together with our animals and the Wildlife of the sky, and so our animals are so much more important to us.
I learned to hate lions as a child.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our stem and our mothers. They're also also dedicated to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions who were killed in Nairobi.
And I think there's only so few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years, is responsible for the cows of his father, and it was my own.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that it wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't go up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find it with a bird.
I wanted the lions to think I was next to the cow's Day.
But lions are very clever animals.
They come, they look at the bird search and they go back, but the next time they come and they say, the thing doesn't even move, it's still here.
And they're going to reach, and kill our livestock.
I stopped the rubble one night. I walked with a tap in the hand around him, and this time, the lions didn't catch up.
So lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
And as a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once once took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day, she brought me almost to me. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a motor drive from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn to the right or left. It's a blind.
And I put a switch on the lights and turn the lights down.
This is a little baby pear in a broken lamp.
And then I built all of this together.
The solar bubble is carrying the battery, which provides the power of the correct plant. I call it a transite generator.
And the right-sensitive whistle-like.
You can see that the lightning shows out of the outside, because from there, the lions come from.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights are going to blink and the lions believe that I'm going to go around the grass. And that's what I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I installed this in our home, and since then we didn't have trouble with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lion in the back of the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're doing pretty well.
So my idea is now used in all Kenya, including other predators like hygiene or leopard, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants of farms.
My invention was a scholarship to a university at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and helps to engage with donations and research.
I even brought my friends home and we install the lights where there is no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I only saw a boy from the savanna who had been wearing cows. I saw airplanes about me and told me, "I'm going to sit in a room!"
And I'm here today.
I was invited to draw a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to become an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to meet the same time, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, and we can live together, side, with the lions, without arguments.
Ash<unk> Oln. In my language, that means, thank you very much.
You don't know what's exciting to hear a story like you hear.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, now, I work on an electrical fence. A single electroz puzzle?
Yes, I know, electrical vune is already invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, not true -- yeah, I've tried to get back, but I've been given back because I got a break.
And it's hard. Richard Turder, you're a bit special.
We're going to be forced to move you up every step of your head, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in the hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and not only I did.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way to shoot a picture, not even at all, but not once the lighting was considered to be considered.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I put my daughter on her first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5th.
And so, just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on from the way.
When the third birthday of my daughter came up with a little bit of attention, "Hey, why do you want Sabina not to New York and do it for a father-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-on to lead the ritual?"
And then we started asking to ask the dozens of tourists to make a picture of ourselves.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, when you get a completely stranger, you know, it's a completely rich black camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, someone has never been washing with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a single-time moment, or a particular journey.
They're also a chance for us for a week in October, to keep the time and change our time and how we've been born a year, not only physical, but in all, in other ways.
Because as we do the same picture, our perspective of time, as they can always reach new curtains, I can see the life with their eyes, and how they deal with everything and how they see it.
and this very intense time that we spend on each other is something that we value and expect every year.
So recently, while one of our travels, we went out and suddenly stayed like they're going to turn, it shows on a red marker on a box of dolls that they learned as a young kid, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old in exactly the same place.
She said she remembered her heart of the chest when she first saw the store for nine years ago.
And now it looks in New York to high school schools, because it's really important to study in New York.
And I realized that the most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious capacity of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not too long in a family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the image.
I want to encourage each of you to come up with this image and you don't ask someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 23.45, 54.4/30.6/18.3/11.3 (BP=0.968, ration=0.969)
