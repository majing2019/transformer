When I was 11 years old, I was dipped by the sounds of the sounds of a day.
My father was listening to his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at that time, because he was mostly covering the news.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it was obviously my father, very happy.
"Now you can go to a right school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban was moving the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was five years old, and I was committing my older sister who was not allowed to go to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
We took another way every day so that nobody could guess where we went.
We're hidden in the bookstore so we're going to see it's like we're going to go shopping.
We're done in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was a fake, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the lesson had to suddenly fall out for a week, because the Taliban had signed their head.
We've never been sure how much they knew about us.
Are we paying away?
Do you know where we live?
We were scared, but we were still going to go to school.
I was very lucky enough to grow up in a family where education was important and received daughters.
My grandfather had been far ahead of his time.
He was a foreign guard from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he was able to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was violated by his father.
My mother was a teacher.
That's her.
She went to the seventh school two years ago, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- the first one in his family ever received an education.
And it was always clear that his children would get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He looked at it as a much larger risk to send his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was so frustrated by our lives, of course, of the constant fear and the perspective.
I had good love to give up. But my father said, "Toy, wait for me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be cut out of your house.
But one thing will remain. What's inside of this, and even if we have to pay our blood for your tea, we're going to do that.
So -- well, you want to give me another one?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have a higher degree as a professor, and if my family had not been used so much for my education, I would be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today, as a proudly unraver in the Middlebury College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he was paying his daughters to school, one of the first people who was congratulated.
He's not just with my high degree, but also that I was the first woman and I was to drive him with the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've helped to start the SOLA, and maybe the first board for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school training is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school are looking at great ambition for all of them to make their chances.
And to see how their parents and fathers are standing for them, as my parents were then for me, despite all the end of the land.
Like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he was walking home to the home of SOLA in her village, and they are dead through a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rang and a voice was attacked, if he was going to school, she would try it again.
He said, "I'm going to let me say, "Well, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter in a game because of your old, over-the-the-day, over-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-day experience."
In Afghanistan, I realized something that's often been rejected in the West: Behind most of us, there's a father who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's also his success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not working in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are focused on and critically appreciating their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And in the Taliban, there were only a few hundred girls in school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are beating the school bank.
Afghanistan seems to be seen by America, so different.
Americans see how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not over the long, and again changing everything from the U.S. troops.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents, who are using them, they encourage them, I see a promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is for me to visit a country of hope and the unregulated possibility, and I remember every day the girls who visit SOLA.
Just as I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, as a profession, as a life, was characterized by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, to 1977 -- I see young, but it's not -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, the CC Coast, Algeria and Somalia, working on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years, we were an Italian good person, and we were very good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we had first found.
Our first project, which was inspired by my first book, to Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show the people in the Sahara, the people in the Sambique, how to raise food.
We came up with Italian tomato and z in South Z.C., in this shaging valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population of the Asian tomato and Anchini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural farming in this area.
But instead of asking why they didn't make anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here!"
"Do you have time to save the people in Sambique before the star."
Obviously, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these amazing tomatoatoes. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said to the Sambers, "Look, how easy is agriculture."
When the tomato was red and red, about 200 pbs of the river came out of the river and everything.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the milper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You've never asked us."
I just thought, we were so great in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French was doing, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
At least we were in the cilus.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we have not yet been calling the unaware African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid," from Dambisa Moyo, she's a post-the-the-goman economist.
The book was published in 2009, in 2009,
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money was doing.
Just watch her book.
So let's read from a African woman, which we've done.
We are Western people, colonists, mission zones, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We're propolis them, or we're patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root, which means "Vater,"
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I suffer every other culture as though they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisis: I'm commuting every other culture than they were my servant.
So, white people are called "bindery," head.
I was so disgusted when I read the book "Dall's wonderful" by the wizzy. He said, especially in the economics, when people don't want help, let's go in.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
Now tomorrow, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that is not a neocololic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to people and create a system called business fund, which never is going to start to be a little bit, somebody will ever be motivated, but you're going to be a local master of the local talent, the local man who has a better person.
What you do -- you're holding your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you're going to join with a local home.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in caf's. We meet in Kneipes.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey someone an idea.
If this person doesn't like, what do you want to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own life is the most important thing for humanity.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful.
The person with the idea is not knowing, but it's available.
So many years ago, I had this case: Why instead of getting into a community and telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
They never have a part of education, and they will never say publicly, what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
You know, planning has this blink.
You don't know the smartest people in the community, because they never seem to appear to be a public meeting.
We work to one to do this, we need to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created by a new profession.
This is the home manager, the National School of the company, with you in the house, sitting on your kitchen table and in the cafe, helping you find the tools, in a way, to change your passion in a way of changing life.
I tried this in a seismal, West Australia, trying to do it.
I was trying to escape at the time, and I was trying to escape the flawy, where we tell others what to do.
And so I went through the streets for the first year, and in the first three days, I helped him, and he brought him to a garage, and he was aquarium in a garage. He was Maori. I helped him to sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came and said, "You know, you've helped us help us help the Maori?"
I helped these five fishers work together, and this wonderful tuna not to sell to a factory in Albanian for 60 cents per<unk>Kilo, but to Japan at Sushi for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them help us." Can you help us help us?"
I was walking 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I feel the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- so the government says, "Do you want it again."
We've done it in 300 communities worldwide.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the development.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on in loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business workers in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter MRI professor was a philosophy professor before he was involved with business. Peter printer said, "Make is actually incompatible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch to know what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with her money and her energy.
You have to learn how to get that to one.
You have to offer them disclosion and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
For what's the presentation you've been paying most credit for this morning?
<unk>Bear, passionate people. You've been paying attention.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the unregurable fossil fuels, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
Automatic combustion engine is not sustainable.
The reforestation of the state is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, transport them, and we can address them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Thank you.
You know? You're sorry.
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1360 in the year.
In 1860 they came together and they were able to do what would happen in the New York City in 100 years. And the conclusion was, the city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? You looked at the curve and said, if the population grows on this speed, they needed six million horses to get people to get people, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd been in the crap.
In 1860, they see the dirty technology that's saving life from New York.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there was 1001 automotive companies in the U.S. -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had done the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered to them disclosion.
They're not coming and they're not coming to you.
Next, you have to offer them absolute, committed, passionate and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about the entrepreneurship.
And from the smallest to the biggest company, all of you have to do is to run three things: that has to be a great product, the market market has to be great, and it has to be massive.
So guess what?
We never met a single person that can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
That's not something that doesn't exist.
This person was never born.
We've done research, and we've been looking at the 100 ivory companies in the world -- Carnegie, Wdohouse, Edison, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world are, one is not just one person's first founded.
Now, we teach 16 Canadian entrepreneurship, and we're starting to teach them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Cobiography. The task is 1633 in the first two sides of Richard Bransographic Cobiography, often use the word "the word and often use the word "weells."
Never again, and 32 times, "we."
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody started a company alone. Nobody was.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, which is a small developer, in cafeteria and Bars, and their committed buddy, who are going to do what someone has done for this gentleman, who speaks about this vague. Somebody says, "What do you need?
What do you do? You can make it?
Okay, you can sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want someone to find you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are supporting corporate leadership to help them find the tools and people, and we found that the wonders of the local government can change the culture and the economy of that community can only begin to identify by the passion and energy of their imagination.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago about how it should be to be Alice in the miracles of the country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communication -- to give engineers education in communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid of those students with their big brains and their big books and their big, I'm not trusted words.
But when the conversation came together, it was about Alice, when she was able to get down to the canyon store and saw a door in a new world.
And I felt like when I was talking to the students, and I was amazed about the thought they had, and I wanted others to find this miracle of this country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need to have great communication from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and our engineers are the ones that are facing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religious scientist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit on.
So I want to show you some ways of making it, as you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy doing with you is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer to is, yes, and?
So, why is your scientific area so relevant to us?
It's not just telling us that their feids are studying, but it's also telling us that their her granddaughter's finger, the her antennae structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat and treat them.
And when you describe what you do, then the misrelated arguments.
Words are a barrier to understand your thoughts.
I'm sure you could use your "f" and you're still doing time," but why don't you just say "Space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
We're going to understand your thoughts is not to cut the same as their level.
As Einstein said, "Well, the things are as simple as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to deal with tradeoffs.
So a few things are about this: examples, stories and analogies. So this way, you can pull us into your vann.
And when you're looking at your work, you're going to take the dots away.
Have you ever been wondering why it's called "Ere point?"
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is just going to be stabbed, and with those dots, the first one is your audience.
A slide like this is not boring, but it also fits too much in the talk-making part of our brain, and that's what we're getting really fast.
This example, by Gene Lindve Brown, is much more powerful. It shows that the special structure of the body is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, simple sentence, where the audience, once it's going to lose the thread, it's going to take pictures and graphics that also cause our other senses and therefore creates a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few ways that help us open this door and see the miracles land that are coming up with science and technology.
And because the engineers I've taught, I've taught, to make the "Nield" in me, I'm going to summarize everything with a equation.
So, look at your science and your paper-oriented, these are the things that are focused on the idea, and so the audience is important, and they're multiplying all the passion that you have for your incredible work, and that's the unfinished interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was really concerned about it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a crime in the human race in Syria.
You can take a phone phone and you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a video with a cell phone, you can take it up on sound file and be famous.
So all of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the road and showed them.
We are in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all these people who were being through and asking change, a cell phone in the bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Keep it up.
Keep your phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. A Android, a Blackberry, wow.
This is a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35.830 lines full of information.
Data data.
And why is this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Goover has signed a legal line.
This rule is called the right line of the protection system.
Now, this rule is that every phone company in Europe, every Internet service agency in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who is calling? Who is sending an email?
Who is sending a text?
And when you use a cell phone, where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people were up and said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have these services.
We want self-sognition in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet services to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see, like tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin and said, "Fake not fear."
And some of them even said this could be going to be on Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the headblone police in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can these really store all of this information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, right?
So I asked my phone company, the Declimate Telegraph, who was the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send all the information that you've stored over me.
And I once asked her, and she said, "I didn't get any right answer. Just a little bit of blue Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life, it's her catalog.
So I decided to put a dish of law against it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the Dice Tele-D, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take back the tag, which is why they're sending me all the demand-makers.
Because in the meantime, the federal court decided that the introduction of the E.U. Senate was a German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown cranp to a CD.
And on the CD, that was it.
35-830 lines of information.
So first I saw it and said to me, well, it's a huge file. It's my hand.
But then, after a while, I realized, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I'm asleep at night, which I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is protective supply.
So with time, with online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I do, I'm going to follow.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to the M<unk>n<unk>s, and how many calls I'm going to run.
So all of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife, and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then a few friends call me up and they call me each other.
And after a while, you call up and you call it up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, where they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see everything.
You can see the central characters, like, who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who's talking to who's going to send a email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi had known who was doing this, and if the Stasi had known who was the leader, it might have never happened.
The case of the Berlin Wall wouldn't have happened.
And it's not the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today's government agencies and companies want to store so many information that they can get over us, online and fair.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it at a long time.
But self-confidence and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-confidence today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So when you go home, you're going to tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you're going to tell yourself, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-being in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: ritual-tiving, rapid-town, Brak.
So the city plan is coming together and thinking about changing the name of South Central so that he's going to be different, and she changed it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes, which is wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Scortional stores, rapid-tiving restaurants, palp spaces.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-Soodus and the Drivebys.
The cometic is that the Drive Behrus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People are dying in South Central Los Angeles in the desert-free disease.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is about 15 times higher than at Beverly Hills, which is about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't even face that.
And I wondered how you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go from the house, the negative effects that you see on your neighborhood.
I've been able to make a flap and sell like plant transport.
I see dialogue centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and food is the solution.
And I didn't like to feel like a little bit at the 45 minutes-minute days to get an apple that's not under-cideimate with pesticide.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's about 45 feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to care.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay."
And I decided to hold it in such a way.
So I came and my group, the L.A. Green Grills, and we started to plant my food, and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We are a kind of a professional group, together, connected by all the social layers and all the city, and it's totally voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone is worth making a mistake.
The city came to me, and he basically came to me a station, and he said that I had to remove my garden, the stock market became a confrontation.
And I thought, "Okay, I'm going, right?
Give us a narrative of how to grow food on a piece of land that is absolutely not true?
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and I talked to the city bank and a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition to Change.org, and we succeeded in 900 regulations.
We thought we were in the hands.
And even as a citymate called it, and said they support it and love what we do.
So, why would they really not do that?
L.A. In the United States, most of the palades in the community.
They have 67 miles in Brak's room.
This is 20 Central Park.
This is enough area to plant 725 million tomato plants.
Why the hell should they not find that OK?
You get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds through the growing plant.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my lunch message, and I'm told people that they should be going to grow their own food.
And to make their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
I'm a graffiti. I'm going to make my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm going to break lawn and sewage.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my abuse for this stuff.
You'd be surprised to see what the Earth floor can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden was becoming an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
They would be wondering how children are influenced by it.
and the most powerful thing is the therapeutic and the most powerful act you can do, especially in the city.
And you can get strawberry cells.
I remember that time when this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 in the night. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said to them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the end of the road."
I was so scared when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that just has empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Foney, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye, no, I'm not afraid she's going to make something wrong.
It's on the street.
So this is the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
And then, in a different time, I put a garden in this homeless home in Downtown.A.
These are the guys that have helped me to put the truck on the wheel.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted with their mother and her grandmother, and it was a great thing to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green Grills have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we had to come up with our zgorms, and we got 50 people and we did it, and these are all volunteers.
If kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomato, they eat tomato.
But if they're not given anything from it, if they're not shown to how food and body affects, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see color kids who are exactly on the path that they're looking for, and they're not going to go anywhere.
I see the garden garden as a chance to train these kids to care for their communities to live a sustainable life.
And when we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole residential garden to the place where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship calls and turn it into a healthy cafe.
So, don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails, because free is not sustainable.
The cometic of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the joy, the pride and honor, when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want to become all of the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gang gardeners.
We need to turn the picture of the cliffs around.
If you're not a garden, you're not a gang.
You're going to be with "fater," right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me when you're sitting in trouble chairs and you want to make a meeting where you're talking about making some check.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, in my garden so we can plant some towel.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nnolly Move."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "<unk>nollyjoster" means "the unhealthy politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper author called "A Snollyboster is someone who is a head-to-the-one, independent, program, or his success through the pure force of the supernatural irrationality."
I have no idea what's called "wasal."
Some of the words, I think, in the way, in the way.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
For example, 1771, according to the British Parliament, newspapers were not the same word of debut.
And that was actually back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was looking at the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave him a hand, but he was courageous enough to say, he was courageous enough to stop, and he finally had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so is much more like Brass."
And the word is, you know, the word is turned to the wheel.
But that's not true. It's not about a convicted of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you with the U.S. at the time when they've just reached independence.
And you saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the state.
You didn't know.
What's called the leader of a universal nation?
There has been an infinite number of arguments in Congress.
And there was all sorts of possible suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the governor Washington, and others, his high-qualityity of George Washington, and again, the rest of the freedom of the United States of Washington.
It's not so special.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought it's worth.
They didn't want to have monarchistist, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have been working.
But everybody was a uncomfortable, because this debate was three weeks ago.
I read the days of a masterpiece who's always writing, "I'm going to have the same issue."
The reason for the tick, and the long-lill was that the assembly house was against the Senate.
What I wanted to do was not want Washington's worth making it. They didn't want to.
And the king might call it, and maybe give it to ideas to his end.
They wanted to give him the most humest, most mouriest title that they thought.
This title was "Poteity."
President. They didn't invent the title. He was just before. But he was just saying that someone was running a collection.
Like, the precaution of a jury.
He didn't have any size than the term "wart," or "Daval."
Sometimes there were a handful of thousands of major conflict and government groups, but it was really a unmanned title.
So the Senate was distracted.
They said, "This is ridiculous, you can't call him a president.
This guy has to sign and signed foreign uteres.
Who will take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like the President of America's United States?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate had not yet.
Instead, you want to use the word "Sictor" to the word, but they wanted to be absolutely clear that they were not agree for their honest respect for the opinions and institutions, whether it's in the Republic of Monarchy, where it's the state of the state of the state of Honest, not necessarily the foreign world -- and the other people in the world.
You can learn three interesting things.
One -- and that's the best I think -- until now, I have no idea whether the Senate ever confirmed the title of the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, only loved the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says that something temporary is -- then you're waiting 223 years later.
And thirdly, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States is not more so humbling, right?
This has a little bit more than 5,000 nuclear swamps that he has and the largest economy in the world and a flab of drones, and all this stuff.
The reality and story has given the size.
And so the Senate won at the end.
You've got an respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the counterfort of self-exqueness -- well, it was this way.
But you know how many nations have a president?
And 147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house was lost because nobody feels very humbling when one is told that you are now the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take, and I'm going to leave you with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality is much more than words that could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a Laster with about 50 rebels in combat with the dinnalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I was painting my black Conclips against a pair of brown leather and a breeber to a rocket in a direction of the government officer I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I was raised with the war, but next to Pyjama party and football, and I was fighting with a racist South-American and non-screen protored protesters who live with the community and Afghanistan and I'd been able to see what I knew.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm here, born by Afghans, South-state University of God Gaden, a political artist who lived last nine years in Afghanistan, and created.
So, there's a lot of great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rain slipples. I want to make art that draws the personality and confuse authority and re-expange the reality and even using a kind of a kind of creative experience to try to understand the world that we live.
I want to spend a day in a jihad --Gittie, which is a jihad teacher, and he's using his jihad against the "Popleblood" and under-soured religious harassment and political corruption.
And what else can be done to the jihad thing, as the parliament should do for the interview and make a choice campaign called the slogan: "Tell me. I do jihad and I'm rich."
And we're trying to use this campaign to allow these Mafani to give birth to a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan and go to the bottom of Afghanistan with a project called "Rearst," where you're going to put a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars, but instead of taking money money from them, and in Kabul, the police police department is willing to give them the opportunity to believe that they're going to take the <unk>1,000 in Afghanistan.
I'd like to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become the "Cart conflict."
The war and the strange views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion, and you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I was in the garden of indigenous peoples with a plant or a variety of unconditional art-friendly fashionwork.
And I'd like to see what a simple band of Kabul looks like in 18998, to create a dialogue about the fact that today's development-based origins have its roots in the past-stounded rhetoric about "The Beem of Man" to protect the brown man themselves and even to protect it a little civil.
But for all of these things, you can get into jail, they can be misdiagnosed, misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I work as a model.
For 10 years, just so, I said.
I feel that this is now building an unspressed tension, because I wouldn't have to put this dress.
I'm lucky, I've got something to change.
This is the first time someone walks to the TED stage, so you can appreciate the happy ones that look at this.
If a few women were really floked when I came out, you don't need to tell me this now, I'll read on Twitter later.
I also think I'm pretty privileged, because I can change something in a very short 10 seconds, which I think you're thinking about.
It's not the chance of the opportunity.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to carry them anyway.
So the hardest part is to move the sweater over my head, because then you're going to all of me off, so you're going to do nothing while it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it was not as uncomfortable as this picture.
It's a picture of powerful, but it's also a superficial.
I've just changed your view of myself in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I had never been a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I was supposed to put my back oil and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides the surgery, or the wrong puppy, I was able to take a big impact of my work two days ago, there's very few ways to change our fears, and that's our phrase -- although it's a super-ficial impact -- a big impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable is to me today.
And I'm standing on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm standing on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to try to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How are you going to be a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model, is a profit in the genetic lottery, and maybe you ask yourself what this legacy is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we have not only defined beauty as a healthy and young and symmetrical, in the revelation of the revelation, we're programmed to be biologically, but also as big, thick, feminine and bright.
And this legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionist are like, "Halt. Naomi, Tyra Smalls. Y.
And first, I'm commentating your model, which is very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. at NYU, all the modules that have signed up every single one that was executed, and that 677 nanoscases were only less than four percent.
The next question that's always been asked to me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown?"
And I'm going to say, "I don't know, that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to really give these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be.
You can become President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja cardiac surgeon, which would be absolutely wrong, because you're the first one."
If they're still saying this amazing crossword, "No, no, Cameron, I want to become a model," I'm going to say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the head editor of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meel.
And to say that you want to be a model later, it's as if you're going to say that you want to win the Jackto in the lottery.
You can't control it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now, I want to show you 10 years of project-based knowledge, because unlike the heart surgeon, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want to run a photo on the run," and then the leg goes up, and it goes up, and it's the arm, and the head is moving back to three-quarters, and you just move back and you're just going back, and you're going to your two-dimensional friends, and you're going to
And then it looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what's happened.
If you finish school and you've finished a life and you've done a few jobs, you're not going to say a lot more, and when you say that you want to be president of the United States, but in life, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking weird.
The next question that often asks me is, "Who is all the photographs going to be stored?"
And yes, as much as all of these photographs are stored, but this is just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've done, and that was also the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my course.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this Shart.
My friend had to join me.
This is on a Pyjama party, a few days before a Shacking for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see these images are not images of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, from Hairstyl and Makeup, and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the evaluation. They're not.
Okay, so next, people always ask me, "What do you do for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-moves-I can't wear, except the things I get free are things that I get, things that I love to get in real life, and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went into a store, and I forgot my money, and I had the dress for free.
As a teenager, I was walking with my friend, a terrible driver, and she was going to be on a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took me, "Son, sir, Mr. Day," and we could go on.
I got these costless things about my view, and there are people who are very little than their personality, and there are people who are not paying for their personality, and they're not paying a high price.
I live in New York, and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and shot last year, 85 percent of black and Latino, and most young men.
It lives in New York, only 17,000 young, male and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Who am I listening?"
But, "How often am I going to stop? When I stopped?"
So in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13 year-old girls don't like their body, and that number goes up at 78 percent when they got 17 percent.
The last question to me is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little thin and shiny hair, then you feel very happy and so fulfilled."
And then back days, we give an answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational people."
Everything is true, but it's only half of the story, because what we never said before the camera, which I've never said before was the camera, "I feel insecure."
And I feel confident because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "What do I feel happier if I had thin legs and gloomy hair?"
And then you should meet a few modules, because they have the most thin legs, and the most spooky hair, and they're just because of their appearance, probably, of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed very hard to get me to get a more honest balance, and then I felt very uncomfortable at that, and I felt like, I was going to go here and say, "I got all the benefits of a pile that was being dakened in my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to make me feel like, "And I'm not always getting happy."
It was very difficult, especially, to open up a legacy of violence and race when I'm one of the biggest users.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this before 10 or 20 years, and I've been completely unmanned, because I'd probably not say how I was going to get my first job, or maybe I'd say, I've paid college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully that we all recognize the power of the image in our misreaded successes and misinformation.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who came to life in exilus, "Son, Gaddafi's Respus. Give him a stop.
But never will be like a Gaddafian revolution."
It's now nearly two years since the monopoly revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass media in both of the world and in the Egyptian revolution.
I joined with a lot of other Libyans, and outside, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrannian regime.
And she was there, a big revolution.
Young, gay women and men, in the first row, were asking the end of the regime, Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved a very compelling courage by asking them to be the brutal dictator of Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity, from the far east above the far west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to break the tyranny.
Gaddafi left a great servant, a legacy of the tyranny, the corruption and the foundation for the end of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed the aerodynamic regime both the infrastructure, and also the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
We've seen the destruction and the challenges, I've been calling as many other women to build the civil society of Lyb, and we'd ask them a substitutation and a refinance transition to democracy and national balance.
Occasionally, 200 organizations were launched, and immediately after the case of Gaddafis in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lyb, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of human development and leadership.
And with a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform of Danian women, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to engage in the sociological empowerment for women, and to the right of the right-being of democracy and in politics.
And in the elections, I was looking at a very difficult environment, a environment that was more polarized, a environment that was characterized by selfish politics of dominance and impairment.
I led a initiative to the peace platform between the aristocracy of women to achieve a legal law, a law that every citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to vote for the right, and to address, in particular, to a political leader between a female and a two-to-level, and to make a decision to make a decision.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nationwide combat in the first elections for 52 years.
But very quickly, the euphoria and the entire revolution came to the entire year, because we were holding new news on violence.
We were looking at the news of the night on the sidewalks and Sufi officers.
And on one morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and attack the message.
And then, again, after another morning, the murderers were signed by the army.
And really every day, we were facing the tyrant of the military and their ongoing ongoing failures against the rights of the rights and their abuse of rules.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice, which they were at the beginning.
So, intolerance, and r<unk>ue, became the icon of the F<unk>nime era of revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our success and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that as a nation, the false choice and the wrong choices.
We've misinformationed our priorities.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or safety into Lybia.
Have the ability to make the difference and change between female and male candidates and national justice?
No, it's not.
So what is it?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate the moral politics of dominance and the opposition of both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only ones that were missing, but the female values of compassion, the Galtade and the union.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus development as it took the elections, which has only increased the polarization and the fragility.
Our society needs the intellectual embodiment of the woman more than they need the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the woman.
We need to stop in the name of the anger and challenge a day of the urge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that is not only paying attention to the following values, but also to blame: Gnade instead of revenge, cooperation, rather than competition,
These are the ideals that need one of the destruction of a broken lybac to achieve peace.
Because peace has a pacie, and in those alchemie, it's about the defenses of feminine and masks.
That's the real balance.
And we need to do this in terms of existential evidence before we do it in societic economics.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," "I'm a word of the Good god, rally."
The word "raver" again, which is known in all the early-month traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "mear" -- "Lear" and symbolized the matal feminine of Greece, all around the man's man's and the female and all the tribes have been.
And just as the mother's lowering the embryo that grows in it, completely expenses the basic posture of compassion all of the existence.
So we're told, "My Gnade is all about anything."
So we're told, "My Gnade has pre-lought before my send."
We all want to be the art of the Gnade.
Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we are looking at the story of Kim Il<unk>lung, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside, except America, South Korea, and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole change time.
At seven years, I saw a public balance, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with a colleague of mine.
And in it, if you were looking at this, our five family members will not be on the world, because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all together on the ground, and our body is so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly, I went through the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
There was a flowery woman on the ground, and a lower child in her arm was shining helpless in his face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because everybody was busy caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million north-Sans of famine were too much more likely to be killed, and many others have only survived because they ate grass, and they ate flower and tree bars.
So the current departments are more and more likely to be, so at night, everything was going to hurt me, except the lights of China on the other side of the user, where we lived.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amad, which is the part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very narrow, and it allows North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell much about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated for a short time from my family.
I'd never thought it took me 14 years to work again.
In China, it was very hard to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea about how life would be as North Carolina refugee, but I soon learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Carolina's refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in a constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible fate to North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police, and was sent to the police department.
Somebody was accused to be Northstathman, so they tested my Chinese counterparts, and they gave me countless questions.
I was so scared, I thought I was going to explode my heart.
So dignity of anything supernatural, I could be locked and signed.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer questions.
After they finished the question, a lawyer said to the other, "This was a false failure.
She's not Northstathier."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for foreign messages in China calledyl, but many of them are caught and signed by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Although they were caught, they finally became released because of massive international pressures.
These North Koreans were not so much lucky.
Every year, there are countless North Koreans in China, and they're released to North Korea, where they're tortured, or they're being locked in public.
Although I was lucky, there's not so much of the North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard to survive.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be replicated in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was leaving myself in Southern Korea, a greater challenge when I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
But I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very different from each other, because of 67 years of the division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean teacher?
Where am I from? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that could have been my home.
Although I didn't notice the adaptation of the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording interview at the University.
Just when I was born on my new life, I got a scary call.
The North Kathan Administration started to pull the money I sent away from my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to resign, to a remote place on the country.
They had to fly as fast as possible, so I started planning their escape.
North Koreans have to have an incredible route to go back to the freedom of their way.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I took me to the north Street path.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to lead them to more than 2,000 miles through China, and then to Southeast Asia.
It took a week, and we got almost thousands of times.
Once the bus was stopped, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the exact shoot of all, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were being arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I was determined, and he said that they were a little kid, and I was her headw.
He looked at me, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go to the la-Eat border, but I had to almost take my money to make the border control of Laos.
But even after we've gone through the border, my family was imprisoned for illegal border resolution.
After I paid money and a bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after my family was incarcerated, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything to keep my family out of freedom, and we've been so close, but my family was arrested just before the South Bronx's message.
I went and I went between the foreign agency and the police department, and I was trying to clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back to pay money or money.
I lost all of my hope.
And then the voice of a man asked me, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised to think that a stranger is concerned about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained to my situation and no sign, he went to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And so I was very happy with him and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't make you." He answered.
"I help the North Carolina Children."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous foreign stranger, for me, was a new hope that needed the North Koreans, and he showed me the friend of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope to need the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I was again in Southern Korea, but the freedom is only a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get into a new country, they start with little and no money.
The international community can help us help us help us learn in education, in English, education and many more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still stay in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to make more hopeful North Koreans to succeed, with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see much more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to have one request here.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
So I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could't be.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them uncomfortable, and he shares them uncomfortable.
It's not a shame. He's not looking at the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he's trying to say, who I'm not even even even even even even even going to remember, he reminds me about one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has absolutely an objectable memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate lady, but he remembers the papers of every book on my iPod, talking about the stories we had when he was four, while the first result of the teystet on my arm and Lady Gagan birthday.
Don't they stop really incredibly?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind is not fit in the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what my heart was encouraging and empowered and empowered, was that although this was the case, although they were not seen as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- and they were illusions and extraordinary.
Well, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "designism," it's a complex disorder of the brain, the social communication, sometimes the learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's a different aspect of each individual, and it's a little bit like Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, a new person in autism will come to notice, and although it's one of the fastest growing economic disabilities in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm living in autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very scared.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world, with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like, cars in a row, to fit the washing machine and eat everything that was under his.
And as he became older, it became different, and the differences became visible.
But behind the anger and the frust, and the never-known hyperactivity, something really unique was a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never had otherwise been.
Amazing.
Well, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of my family, I wish that they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things I wouldn't want to compete against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another way of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it, and in all of us, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The opportunity to do scale, progress, and change dies in the moment we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Ed Negropon, we've been blessed with awe and curiosity, with this photo, with a project of a robot, a apple, and with a mass of mass-long flight, only a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we are a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto photography, a new engineering technology that is so fast that it can create time-saturated images of light.
And so we can build cameras that are going to look at the outside of our view, or see a <unk>-ray in our body, and we can really ask what we call "Mamera."
Now, if I take a laser scanner and I take it in a billionth of a second -- this is a couple of Femtoseconds -- I'm going to make a package of photons that are hardly a tiny millimeter, and this photon package, this project will move into speed, and it's going to move into speed -- and I've said a little bit like a normal project.
So if you take this project, this photons package, and you're going to shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in time, motion-paste?
So this whole event, this event,
So, you think, the whole event is actually taking less than a nanotole -- it takes the light to get back this lane -- but I'm going to add this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola, this research has not financed.
So in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our project, comes into the bottle with a photon package, which starts to move through, and then the end of that,
And a part of the light is flowing out on the table, and you see this spread of the waves.
And so many of the photons eventually end up to the end of the bottle and explode into different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble that's going to be in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves on the table are spread out on the side, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some of the images.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back and take it back to the same track, and then you can slow it back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you're sitting here to see the movie?
Day a day, a week? No, a whole year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little bit of still-time photography?
You can see again, like this waves on the table, the Tomigrates and the wall is swimming over in the background.
It's like when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed like the nature would paint this picture, each of them, a femto image, but of course our eye looks together.
But if you look at this Tombs again, you'll see that when the light is breaking the Tom's, it's not going to remain dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomats is closed, and the light jumps around and comes back to a few billion seconds.
So in the future, if this tapto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket and find out if it's a fruit, and you can't touch it at all.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a very short-time period of air, you're very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your short-term, so you're not going to get that little light at all.
So what we're doing is we're going to send this project, this photons package, a million times, and we're going to try to draw this back and forth with very clever synchronic, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to make this T-LP video that I showed you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: to see corners?
The idea is that we're going to turn something on the door.
It's going to go into the room, and it's going to go back into the door, and eventually it's going to be able to use these more extracting trajectories of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall is a soup, and we're going to break the light on the door.
After our paper was published in the Gure Communications, it was released by Nature.com, and they made this animation.
We're going to be able to break this light project, and they're going to push it on this wall, and these photons are going to be put in all directions, and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden soup that will break the light, and then then then the door will reflect a piece of light and a tiny fraction of the photons, and then they'll come back to the most interesting camera at the time.
And because we have a camera that is so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
She has a very good time-effective solution, and she can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by cutting a laser, we can take a pipe image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but then when we record many of these images, dozens of these images, and then we try to analyze the different light circuit, we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit to do before we can do this from the lab, we can build cars that are out of collisions, and we can see what's behind the curve, or we can look for dangerous injury, and we can look at light, and we can't see the open window, or we can build the endcope, and we can see the body in Okcope, and also see it's going to see the box of powder.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging question, which is really a game call for scientists, now thinking about Femto photography, because there might actually solve a new visual model of medical model.
So, as Doc Negroponte, a scientist, a science has become an art, an art of the ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we collect every time, not only using scientific imaging. We can create a new form of computer photography, and we can't look at the wave of the other time, and we can't even look at the surface of that wave between the time.
But it's something fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottle, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that we've seen almost in the speed of light, we've seen some weird effects, and Einstein would like to see this picture incredibly.
The order in which events in the world appear in a new order, in the camera, is by using the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether it's a visual representation of photography, or the creation of a new visual tool for medicine, or new design, since we've been able to open all the data on our website, and hope that the "Soreership" and the research community, we should stop to start to start to start to make the second 3D map, and we should start to start the next two-dimensional microscope.
It's time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives.
We don't meet any neighbor on the street so many convictions don't get passed away, but we use the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a taps, a fractures and a circle.
The projects came from my questions, how much rentes my neighbors?
How do we borrow more things without worrying with each other?
How do we divide our memories from the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how do we share our hopes for existing houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the huge oily, which has been held for hundreds of years, drunk and cran, and a shade of shadow. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone ever ever ever ever, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city of most abandoned possessions in America.
I live near this house, and I thought, how I can make it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a great gratefulness for my life, and it brought me clarity about the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life, forget what's really important.
And then with the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a giant board, and I wrote a pipe on the gaps, and I said, "I'm going to die, I want to live ..." I want to take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share his hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day was completely filled with the wall, and it was growing.
I want to share some sentences with you, and people were written on the wall.
"Tell I die, I want to be sued for piracy."
"Wait me, I want to be dead, I want to stand on the International Record."
"Wait I die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Wait I die, I want to plant a tree."
"I'm hungry, I want to live in a webless."
"Tell I die, I'd like to hold it in my arms."
"Tell I die, I want to be somebody's cavial."
"Tell I die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place, and the hopes and dreams of people, brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and understanding it in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space and thinking, and remembering what's most important in us as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I received hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a construction box, and now we've been built worldwide in countries like Kazanhstan, Australia, Argentina, other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to address our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships for other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view, and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often sentenced to talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is the most of us.
So the idea of death is that it gives us life.
We're looking at our common places, which is important to us as individuals and as a community, and with more possibilities to share our hopes and our fears, and stories, people can help us make us better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, I'm involved with a very sophisticated math, a special problem for anyone who is engaged in collaboration with more than business workers.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today I'm going to try and explain what I'm doing.
and dance is one of the most human activity.
We are so excited when we were watching the secret ball and the wages, as you're going to see.
For the ballett, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and capabilities, and maybe a fundamental imperative that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders, like Parkinson's, are slowly destroying these extraordinary ability. It's also what it's doing with me with the people who were talking to Jan Abri Interpling, who was at his time a ballet surgery.
Over the years, we've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
But yet, in the world, there are 6.3 million people who suffer on this disease, and they have to live with the abusive symptoms of weaknesses, treasure, semen, and other people who are living that disease, so we need an objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know is whether there is a cure when we have an objective measure that might answer this question.
And trouble is that there's no biomarkality of Parkinson's and other movements, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is this is this 20-minute test for neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials never will.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a failed tour to the hospital. What if patients could make this test themselves?
It wouldn't require a very expensive hospital worker.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to look at the neurological department.
So I want to suggest you an unconventional method that we're trying to do this, because we're all, in some sense, virtual poses like my metan Strival.
Here's a video of the vibrating mood.
This is happening in a healthy state, if someone has been made a speech, we can look at ourselves as a misready ballbox, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs, if we could make the sounds, and we all have the genes for that. Fox2, C2.
And as ballet, it requires an enormous amount of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until learning it is.
And by the way, we can see the position of the vibrant vocal lobe, and the way the limbs are affected, the vocal muscles of Parkinson's disease.
You can see an example of irregular vocal resonance.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
Union, weakness, weakness, weakness, denial.
The language will even be more and more fry, and that's an example of it.
Now, this impact on the voice can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and randomness software, combined with new machine engineers that are now advanced, so we can now see where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the deer.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
It's pretty little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both of them are exactly. They're not going to be done by experts.
So they can be done independently.
They're very fast, they're about 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can use it in a large scale.
These amazing goals we can do with this.
We can reduce logistic difficulty for patients.
Patient patients don't have to have routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through a broad observation.
We can do cheap mass training for clinical trials, and we're going to have a study of all the population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now we're going to start the first step in this direction, we're going to start the Parkinson's dilemma.
and we want to take a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough outputs for those goals.
We have reputation numbers that are accessible to a billion people on this planet.
Each one can be done with no Parkinson's disease, it can be cheap to leave images for a few cents, and I'm already known to be a lot of joy that we've already reached six percent of our goal in eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples of the samples, we're going to take 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy from them and who's not?
What do you do with all these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to say during the call, whether this person is suffering from Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them will not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important, because we are to set up to see what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
It's got 86 percent accuracy at the moment?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to make it a great job because he's done this fantastic work -- so it's also shown that it works on the cell phone network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means that people can -- people can call it with the phone and make the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, take their voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max, Max, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows of my father, and that's behind the kitchen center, the Beijing National Park.
The Beijing National Park is just in the south, and that means that wildlife animals can rely on the park at any given time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was our only hike.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believes that we were getting together with our animals and the rest of the sky, and that's why our animals are so much.
As a child, I learned to hate lions.
Our warriors are called Morans. They protect our tribe and our Heran. They're also dedicated to this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's just as few lions in the Nairobi National Park.
In my tribe, a boy between six and nine years, is responsible for his father's cows. So it was my case.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions are helping to see cows better.
But I didn't go up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I was trying to find a bird's book.
I wanted the lions to think, I'd come next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You'll come, you see the bird search and go back again, and the next time they come, and they'll come and say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they're going to take control, and they're killing our livestock.
One night, I was looking at the Stall. I was walking around with a tap in the hand around him, and this time, the lions didn't catch up.
And lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
As a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio apart from my mother, and the day, she was almost about me, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a balance from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn to the right or left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights and turn the lights.
This is a little pear, out of a broken pockets of a lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar bubble is able to absorb the battery, which provides electricity to the correct plant. I call it a transneuron.
And the right plant is flashing.
You can see that the pears are pointing out, because there are lions coming from there.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions think I'm going to go around the rubble, and that's what I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been in our home, and we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I built the lights. You can see the lion in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including other predators like hyena, or leopard seals. The lights also serve to keep elephants from sea.
My invention was to give me a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and helps with donations and research.
I even brought my friends home, and we install the lights together where there's no one there, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
One year, I only had a boy from the savanna, who was crying his cousin, and I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a seat."
And I'm here now.
I was invited to draw a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a radiator and a pilot. This is my big dream.
I used to cover lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father, and we can do it together. We can live on the side with lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, that means, I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your attention.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electrical fence. A motor puzzle?
Yes, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, you've tried to, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've been back to the try because I got a -- a stroke.
All of the things are hard. Richard Turder, you're a little special.
We're going to be going to be a step on your head, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Since I'm old enough to hold a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite shows, and no one of them have done it.
There was no kind of director, no style, no way of shooting a picture again. Not even the lighting was being explored.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story started when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I hold my daughter on her first birthday. We were on the corner of 57 and 5s.
And we went back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this goes out --
When the third birthday of my daughter came up with my wife, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina to New York, and do it a father-in-law to continue to continue to lead the ritual?"
And then we started asking the last day-tested tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to make a complete stranger.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, someone has never been touched with our camera.
And we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken just after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than a single-term moment, or a particular journey.
They are also a chance for us to keep time in October, and to change our time and how we change our year to year, not only physical, but in everything.
Because although we always do the same picture, our perspective changes as time, as they're always reaching new fragments, I can see the life with their eyes, and how they're dealing with everything and how they see it.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something we value and expect for every year.
So, as one of our travels, we went out and suddenly we stayed like this, it's going to look like a red mark on a red hood, which they had learned as a little kid, early travel.
And she told me about her feelings she had had as a five-year-old who had exactly this place.
She said she remembers her heart of her chest when she first saw the store nine years ago.
And now, it looks in New York for high schools, because it's really important to study in New York.
And I realized that it was obvious. The most important thing we all create is memories.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious capacity of memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at a very little family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes this picture.
I want to encourage each of you to come up with this image and don't ask someone, "When do you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 24.30, 55.1/31.4/19.4/12.3 (BP=0.959, ration=0.960)
