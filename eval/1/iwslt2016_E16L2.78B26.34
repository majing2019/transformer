When I was 11 years old, I was stabbed one morning by the sounds of thinner.
My father stopped on his little, gray radio show at the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because the news was largely depressing.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father, obviously, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'll never forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban were taking power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was stoked for five years as a boy, and my older sister was preparing to go on his own, to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school both of them.
Every day, we took a different way to guess where we were going.
We're hidden in our books in shopping bags so that it looked like we're just going to go shopping.
We were done under a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
In the winter, it was kind of a fake, but in the summertime it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were condemned our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over and over again, the class suddenly had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had been looking at the same.
We were never quite sure how much they knew about us.
Did they stop us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote Afghan society. He insisted to his daughter -- my mother -- to send to school and was violated by his father.
My mother was educated, but she was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire only to transform our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever to get a school.
For him, it was always clear that his children would get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much bigger risk of not sending his children to school.
I know that in the years of the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, of the constant fear and the moodless.
I was very good enough to give up, but my father said, "Tommy, wait for me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can be distributed in the war from your house.
But one thing will remain with you is, what's in this room. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we'll do that.
So -- you still want to give up."
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree as a high degree as the Sekundar, and if my family hadn't been used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proud absolute junior of the Middlebury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he was paying attention to his daughters to school, one of the first people to challenge me.
He doesn't just push me with my college degree, but also to say that I was the first woman to be walking around the car in Kabul.
My family believes me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helping to start the SOLA, the first, and perhaps the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where girls are still riskful for girls.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to see the potential.
And seeing their parents and fathers as they are standing for them, as well as my parents, despite all the other things that were expected.
So like Ahmed Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of a student.
A month ago, his daughter and he was walking out on the way from SOLA to her village, and they were out of death through a bomb on the side by a few minutes.
When he got to home, the phone rings, and a voice burned him when he left his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "I'm going to be pissing up if you want, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future on the game because of your old-fashioned and over-fetching ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've come to realize something that is often missed in the West: From most of us who have success, there's a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and the awareness that her success is also your success.
That's not to say that our mothers aren't important for our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are starting to come and be convincing to be the most promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
Now, under the Taliban, only a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
Americans recognize how uncertain changes are.
I'm afraid that the change are not over the long term, and the distribution of the U.S. troops are changing everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents who are using them for them, they're encouraging, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan is for me a country of hope and the unconcited possibilities, and every day, the girls who visit SOLA.
Just like I have big dreams.
Thank you.
All I do is work with, including my life -- was shaped by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971 to 1977, I'm young, but I'm not -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on projects with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was so desperate.
I thought 21 years ago we were Muslim-of-the-of-the-day people and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we first found.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples of the Zambezi," was one where we wanted to show the people of the Muslim of Sambias to how food was being grown.
We got to Southeast Italian seed, in this shiny valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population to grow Italian tomatoes and to Bechini.
Of course, the local workers had absolutely no interest in this, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such fertile empire of agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't set up, we just said, "Thank you for God we're here!"
"Pake a little bit of time in time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had this gorgeous tomato tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said the sambors, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, over the night, over 200 nousles were out of the river, and they were grading everything.
We said to the Samble, "Oh God, the nilper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that? "You never asked us?"
I just thought, we were so brilliant in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French countries were doing, and after I saw what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
At least we were feeding the pine ponds.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we have not delivered the window of African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a dy-American economist.
The book was published in 2009
We've given the world's population of African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read her book.
Check out about a African woman, what we've done.
We Western people are imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every other culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisisative: I suffer every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "bwana," the boss.
I was crippled when I read the book "Swall" by the Beautiful. He said, most importantly in the economic development, when people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, he opened a pole on the floor and said, "Can you imagine a city that isn't neocolatic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond only to people, and I invented a system called business promotion, where no one is ever initiated, no one's ever motivated, but you're going to become the service of the local passion, the local people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit down with a local community.
We're not working from offices.
We're in cafes. We're in cafes. We're in Knellipen.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're closing friends and finding what the person wants.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can convey an idea to someone.
If this person doesn't like what you're supposed to do?
The passion for the growth of the person's growth is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing in human life.
We help them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Now, many years ago, I had this epiphany: Why not if you come to a community and say to people what they should do, why don't we listen to them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have entrepreneurs in a row, and they will never say publicly what they want to do with their money, what opportunities they see.
You have this spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be on public meetings.
We're working on one to do this, needs to be made social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
There must be a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's house manager, the shop doctor of the company, who's sitting with you in the house, on your kitchen table and in the cafeteria, helps you find the resources, your passion to transform life.
I tried this in a seperality, West Australia.
I was tweeting at the time, trying to escape the flushion, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking through the streets in the first year, and I was on the streets, and I was able to get my first three days of customers. I helped him get fish in a garage, and he was Maorii. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came to the streets, and they said, "You've helped the Maori. Can you help us?"
I helped these five fish, working together, and this wonderful tuna not to sell to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million, but to Japan for 40 dollars at Sushi, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"
I had 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do?
How do you do? I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I'm holding the mouth and listening to them."
So -- so the government says, "Cake it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in the founding companies.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to cross loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best companies in the history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter MRI was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Creation is really unfinished with a social society and economics."
Reject is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest human being want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get to one of them.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come back.
In a community of 10,000 people, we'll get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
For what presentation you most applaud the best, are you guys making tomorrow?
"Sit, loving people. You applaud them.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- decisurable fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion machine is not sustainable.
The Freonon epic of preservation is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, build, transport, and then we can deal with them.
The technologies are not there.
Who will invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget.
The government? Forget it!
They'll be entrepreneurs. And they're already doing it.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine a lot of years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were rearranged, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a complete: The city of New York would no longer exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, as the population is growing on this pace, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get the crap of six million horses.
Because they'd been in the crap.
In 180, they see the dirty technology that's eating lives in New York.
What happens? 40 years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
The first thing you have to do is to have to be offered discretion.
Otherwise, they don't come and talk to you.
The next thing you have to do is provide them absolutely, engaged, passionate service.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
Of the smallest and the biggest company, everybody must be able to perform three things: that must be a grand product, the market market market has to be grand, and the financial law has to be huge.
So guess what?
We never met one person who is producing something at the same time, selling and having to care about money.
This is not something that exists.
This person was never born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world are all mean, one thing: No one was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in North Korea, and we start teaching them the lessons to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autobiography, and the job that's 16 year-old, is to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons autobiography as often as the word "I'm using and often the word "we."
Never "ich" and 32 times we are.
He wasn't alone when he started.
No company founded alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitators who have a small professional background, sit in cafes and bars, and the partner sister who are going to do what someone for this gentleman who talks about this epito. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find someone for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who are helping corporate entrepreneurs to help them find the means of the tools and the people, and we've found that the wonder of the intelligence of the local population is that the culture and the economy of this community can be transformed only by the understanding of the passion, the energy and the imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've been through the experience of how it should be, I've got to know, Alice, in the miracle country.
The Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communication -- asking engineers to give up communication.
I was scared.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, I'm not trusting words.
But when they got to the conversation, it was like Alice, when she was pushing down to the case of the castle and saw a door in a new world.
And so I felt like I was having conversations with students, and I was amazed at the thoughts they had, and I wanted others to discover this wonder of this wonderful country.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are addressing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and it's not going to go forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-religist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations don't come when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miracle country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're engaging with is sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, what?
It tells us why your scientific area is so relevant to us right now.
It's not just that they're studying their sneakers, but also tells us that their sneakers, their fatty structure in our bones, because they're important to understand and treat osteopalosis.
And if you describe what you're doing, then you're making out of useless words.
Now, arguments are a barrier to understanding your mind.
Certainly, you could use your tidy-time cleaner and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," which is much more understandable for us?
So to make your mind understood, it's not the same as your level slowed down.
As Einstein said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Now, to consider some things, examples, stories and analogies, in this way, you can take us in your cheeks.
And when you present your work, the dots go away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "reverse"?
What happens when someone is over here? Another one is being stabbed, and with those dots, the first person is your audience.
A slide like this is not just boring, but also too much on the discussion work of our brains, and that's what we're getting really excited about.
This example of Gene Bonvieve Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the worm is so stable that even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower worm.
The trick here is to use a single, simple, playful sentence where the audience, once it loses the thread, can use images and graphics that also encourage our other senses, and therefore creates a deeper understanding of what it represents.
These are just a few ways that can help us open up those towers and see the wonders land that makes science and technology happen.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've been taught to participate in making the "The Slice" tight in me, I want to sum everything with an equation.
When you look at your science and your sub-conceptions, you divide them through the relevance, which is the audience, which is important, and multiply the whole thing that you have for your incredible work, and that makes you more unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you've solved this equation, I'm really looking at it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can film a surgery with a cell phone. You can film a crime in Syria.
You can tweet a phone and you can start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get high-wire on sound club and get famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in Berlin in 1984, in 2000,
Let's go back to that time in this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and demonstrated change for change.
We've been in the fall of 1989 and imagine that all of these people who came out and asked change had a cell phone in their bag.
Who in the room has a cell phone with it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every cell phone has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and my cell phone about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Tumpy data.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.S. embassy has set up a right line.
This is a policy line called the supply of the supply chain.
This is a policy that every telephone company in Europe has to store every Internet service administrator in Europe, a range of user information.
Who calls who? Who is sending an email?
Who is texting who is sending a text message?
And when you use a cell phone, you use where you are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, two years from your phone company or your Internet service company.
And everywhere in Europe, people have been up and said, "We don't want that."
They said we don't want to have this fiscal supply system.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about ourselves.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want it."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people were streaming on the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And even some said this could be on Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Lumleimpolian in Eastern Germany.
And I also wonder, is this really working?
Can the real information that we've seen about ourselves?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using it?
So I asked my phone company, the German Telegraph, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send me all the information that you saved over me.
And I asked her once, and she asked me again, and she didn't get the right answer. Just the darker Bla Blaa.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening with it.
So I decided to put a legal court on it, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German post said no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end of it, it happened compared to them.
I'm going to take back the charges of what they were sending me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court trial decided that the introduction of E.U. Senate was a legitimate violation in the German.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD, that was it.
35830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My back.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start with this?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm in the night, I'm sleeping, which I'm doing.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called a security system.
So with time, online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can track every step I do.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to Cl oil, and how many calls I'm going to run along.
And all of this is possible by this information.
That makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just calling my wife and she calls me up, and we're talking a few times together.
And then a couple of friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you're calling up and you're calling up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all of this.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is talking to whom to send an email, all of this is possible when you have access to that information.
And that information is stored at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I first said, let's imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their bag.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, it might never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would have not happened.
And even after that, not the case of the icy of the icy curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so much information, as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to track our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age are not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to struggle every day.
So when you go home, your friends are telling you that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you're talking about your foreman, just because companies and government places have the opportunity to store specific information, they don't have to do it long yet.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company for the information they stored over you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: Conventional bedrooms, rapid-diving restaurants, Brakk.
So the city plan is coming together and thinking about changing the name of South Central, so that it stands for something else, it changed it in South Los Angeles as if something is changing in the city wrong.
This is South Los Angeles.
Tortional stores, rapid-diving restaurants, Brakkak spaces.
Like 26,5 million other Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, home from the Driveby and the Drivebys.
The weird thing is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a curable condition.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't stop thinking about that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, you can see the negative effects that the existing food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to see that skirts are bought and sold like use trucks.
I see dialysis centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I made the decision that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't like to have a joke for 45 minutes of scanning to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food hotcase in my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park plant.
It's about 45 to four feet.
The thing is, it's the city.
But you have to practice it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to stay there."
And I decided to keep it in there.
So I and my group, L.A. Green Grills, and we started to plant my food hotspot and fruit trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We're kind of a pre-medits group, and we're connected from gardening all the social layers and all the city, and it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone was complaining.
The city came up to me, and he basically gave me a carrier, and said I had to remove my garden, the waiting car became a huge impact.
And I thought, "Well, I'm going to go on, right?
A narrative of how food is used in a piece of land that you're totally not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her name."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he talked to the city Council and a member of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition on Change.org. And we succeeded with 900 signatures.
We stopped the victory in his hands.
My townmate even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why wouldn't they do that?
LA. In the United States, most of the palades in the property of the city.
They have 67 kilometers in Brakall.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why on the devil shouldn't they find that well?
And by growing a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get a dollar worth of fruit and vegetables at 75 dollars' worth of food.
It's my cure, I tell people that they should grow their own food.
To grow their own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this preconceived reality that's made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
"Cort work is my graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's been sampling walls, I'm going to keep lawns and sewage facilities.
I use the garden, the earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my closest to this stuff.
You would be surprised to see what the Earth's soil can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my garden as an instrument of education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
You would wonder how children are affected by it.
Sorts are the most therapeutic and most courageous act you can do, especially in the city.
And then you get strawberry straws.
I remember that time that mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my garden, and I got out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not on the street for the reason."
I was ashamed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that only empowered me to do this. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aye, no, I'm not afraid they're laughing.
It's on the street.
So that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take your health back."
I used to put a garden in this homeless home in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to plumb the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them and how it stored with her mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even if it were just for a moment.
Green grassts have already planted about 20 gardens.
And when we went to our circledments, 50 people came along and did it, and these are all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon, they eat coal.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they don't show up how food and body affects, they're blind, whatever you're accustomed to.
I see young people who want to work, but they're stuck in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that are as perceived for them, and they're not going to go anywhere.
The gardeners see this as an opportunity, where we can train these kids to care for their communities to live sustainable lives.
And if we do, who knows who?
We could produce the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground Earth's soil, we'll never do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire neighborhood of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship containers and turn them into healthy cafes.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free snuck, because free is not sustainable.
The theme of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the joy, the pride and the honor when you're building your own food, and when you open farmers' markets.
So what I want to do here is make it sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, gangs.
We need to turn the picture of the weather.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You're going to be a hike with a walker, right?
And let the gun be the weapon of your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit in smart chairs and want to make a meeting where you talk about doing any cheeks.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skip, in my backyard so that we can plant any fakes.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And "nollynnnnar" means "unctless politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper host was a better definition: "A Snollyyner is someone who is a post-elected office, independent of party or program or contract, and his success by the pure power of the aristonic deconialness."
I have no idea what paper is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So for example, 1771, according to the British Parliament, the newspapers were not the least words of debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name, Brass Crosby, who went on with the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it to him, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to refend, and then finally he had so much support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we're going to find the first confession of this sentence "so" as strong as Brass." A lot of people think.
And so, roughness is the word for the black.
But that's not true. It's a convicted driver of the freedom of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time that it's been achieved on independence.
You would look at the question of, how do you call George Washington, the head of the head?
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
And it's been discussed for almost a long time in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions about computational suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-vality of George Washington, and again, the regulations of the freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's so weird.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought it was a good thing to do.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this paper because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the diary's journal, writing all the time, "I've got the same issue."
The reason for the delay, and the long-term boredness was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good deal. They didn't want to.
King call it, and maybe even gives it to ideas about his success.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, the most disquestuous title that they thought of.
This cover was "Pountor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that someone had a gathering.
Something like the precautionary of a jury.
He didn't have the same size anymore than the record "written" or "aater."
Sometimes there were young presidents of small, single-scale, civil society groups, but it was really a non-obvious title.
So the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "That's ridiculous. You can't call it President.
This guy has to sign claims and meet foreign carriers.
Who is going to take him seriously if he has a stupid little title like the president of America?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate was not there.
Instead, it didn't seem like the term "The Prince of the Mind," but they were totally clear that they were not satisfied because of their honest respect for the opinions and practices of civil nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's omniction that the head of the state is respecting the head of the state -- not necessarily the presidency of the presidents, the other nation.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First of all, and I think that's best at this point -- I've never been able to figure out if the Senate has ever been officially validated the president.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just loved the title. He just stops waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that when a government says that something is temporary -- you're waiting for 223 years later.
And third, and that's really important, and that's the most important thing, is that the title of the United States of America today is no longer so humbling, right?
This has more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and history have given the title of the scale.
And so the Senate won at the end.
They have a respectful title.
And the other concern, the persecution, the persever of self-destruction -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear swamps and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house got lost because no one feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave you with that.
Politicians are using words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the words are much more than words that could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 rebellion at the combat of jjalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I would be singing my black Conclight half-foot shoes against a pair of brown leather moops and heat a rocket towards the government's chief that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I'd been big with the war, but next to Pyjama parties and football talks at Sams and commotion with racist South Africa and di-sian protests who never lived with communism and live for Afghanistan and travel for years, and also pushing out prewords before I knew what it was.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm standing here, born-in-own, South-states of God's God Gnnaden, a culturally socially-cented artist who's been working and created for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So in Afghanistan, there are great things about art that you could do, but I personally don't like to paint rainbows. I want to make art that motivates your personality and characterizing and rewriting reality and even the kind of creative folk's study to try and understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- Wangday girl who's doing jihad against his jihad, like "Popstar" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can be the ultimate warrior than to run for the parliament and do a choice campaign with the slogan: "Excuse me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow those mafiosi to be able to take care of as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, with a project called "Runation," where you're a cop, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and keep cars, but instead of taking bribes of them, providing money to them, and in the names of the police in Kabul, they're acclaiming them, and they hope that they're going to take us 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, in the context of the world "modest conflict."
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I would support from the local Afghan dress with a protected or a few recycled cleaning rooms in a fashion new, super-meduinrative work.
And I'd like to see what a simple pointer from Kabul looks like between 24iplings Appell, to create a dialogue about the current development institutions that have its origins in the past colonial rhetoric about "The White Beem" in order to protect the brown man from themselves and maybe even a little bit of a civil.
But for all of these things, you can come to jail, you can be misdiagnosed, misinterested.
But I do it because I have to, because I need to, because the geography of the self needs it.
That's my burden. What's your deal?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for a while, I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, just about 10 years, I was saying.
I feel like you're building a uncomfortable tension in this room, because I shouldn't have been attached to this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit to change with this.
This is the first time someone is attracted to the TED stage, so you can be happy to see this.
If some women were really cheating when I came out, you don't need me to say this now, I read later on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds what you think of me.
There's no chance of this.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to move the sweater over my head, because then you're all going to wake me off, so you're not doing anything as long as it's over my head.
All right.
So why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Now, it wasn't that easy to do that, hopefully, as awkward as this picture.
A image is powerful, but a picture is also super-simplifious.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I was really never a friend of mine.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to use my back to eat and hold my hand into the hair of this guy.
And beyond surgeries or the wrong tan that I had to spend two days ago on work, there are very few ways of changing our utterances, and our utterances, even though it's superficial and irreducible -- a major impact on our lives.
Being fear is to be honest today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a cute white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, how are you going to do a model?"
I always say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical in the sense of admiration that we're programmed biologically, but also as big, courageous, feminine and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it's a legacy that was handed out for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe some fashion-in-law calls, "Haltie. Naomi, Tyan Smalls. Liu.
And first I'm comment on your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the length, each individual that was being humiliated, and that 677 times were only 27 or less than four percent of the world's.
The next question that I've been asked is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, it's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is, "Why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President of the United States or the inventors of the next Internet or a Ninja psychiatric expert, which would be completely wrong, because if you were the first one."
If they still say that great cross-counting note, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who's my boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of American bird or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meelel.
and to say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying you want to win the Jackossto in the lottery.
You can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career course.
Now I want to show you 10 years of working models, because different from heart surgeons, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice cyclimeter, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a photo to run," now the leg goes first, and the arm goes back, and that arm goes back, and the head is three-quarters, and you just move back and you just go back, and you see, like, 300 times your friends were newborn, 300 times, and then you're going to your eyes,
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
This was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and have a few jobs and have done a few jobs, you can't say much. If you want to be president of the United States, but in the lifetime, there's 10 years of underwear, you'll see weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is saving all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was the first time I was a Bikini. I didn't even have my own period.
I know this is going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this clip.
My girlfriend had to join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a few days before a magazine for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructs, and they're constructed a group of professionals, from Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and Stylists and all their assistants and the pre-program. They're programming. That's me.
Okay, so nextly, people always ask me, "You war for nothing?"
Yes, I have too many 20-c-mix shoes that I can't wear, except the things I get free are things that I get in real life and don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and I gave the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was driving my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took me, "Excuse me, Mr. Winner champions," and we were able to keep going.
I got these free things because of my appearance and not because of my personality and there are people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality paying a high price.
I live in New York, and we live in 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and filtered over the last year, and 85 percent of black and Latino and most of the young men.
It lives in New York only 17,000 young, male and Latinos, for which you don't ask the question, "Am I listening?"
But, "How often am I going to be stopped? When I stopped?"
And in my research on this talk, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their bodies, and that number is up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I have is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little thin and shiny hair, you feel very happy and fulfilled."
And back days, we have an answer that might give you this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel as much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational, passionate people."
All of this is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I never said before the camera, is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I be happier if I had a thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most awkward hair and the coolest rubber, and they're because of the appearance of the most uncertain women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable with getting here and saying, "I got all the benefits of a pile that was being bent into my favor." And it doesn't feel like it's not so good to add to the next, "And I'm not always happy."
It was very difficult, especially, to close a legacy of oppression because of gender and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I think it's great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years of my career has passed, because I'm probably not going to tell you how I got my first job, or I'd not be able to tell you how I was going to go, or maybe I'd be told, like college, which is so important.
If you take something out of this talk, hopefully we'll all recognize the power of the image in our misidentification and misconceptions more.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who have come to life in exile, "Son, hammafi resistance. Give him a lie.
But never will be like a Gaddafi revolution.
There have been almost two years since the Libyan revolution, inspired by the waves of mass incarcerations in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I would join a lot of other Libyans, within and outside Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gadadia.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, gay women and men were in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, kept Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved some seminal courage by being assigned to the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong meaning for solidarity, from the far east above the distant West, to the south.
After all, after six months of brutal war and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and reduce the tyranny.
Gaddafi has left a big criminal, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed all the aerodynamic regimes and the infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the pink culture.
The devastation and the challenges, I feared how many other women are rebuilding the civil society of Lybia. We asked a participatory and legitimate transition to democracy and national jurisdiction.
Near 200 organizations have been founded, and immediately after Gaddafis, Gaddafis, in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops on the issues of human development, human development and leadership skills.
With a wonderful group of women, I founded the peace platform called Libyes, a movement of women, leaders of different life, whose goal is to enter the sociopolitical empowerment of women, and to the right to the right-being of democracy and peace development.
In the pre-viewing, I was at a very difficult environment, a environment that has more and more polarized. A environment that was shaped by selfish politics of dominance and perse.
I led a initiative to the Peace Contite of Libyters's Women to achieve a participatory election, a law that anyone, no matter what context it should be, no matter what it should be, and at least for political parties, a link between male and female, on the vertical level, and at the same level, and making a complete denial.
At the end, our initiative has been taken and successfully.
Women won 17.5 percent of the nation's national justice prosecutors in the first elections for 52 years.
But quite frankly, the euphoria of elections and the entire revolution after <unk> we were making new messages about violence every day.
We were facing a morning about the marriage of the day-winning of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then, another morning, the wounded were signed by the army.
And really every day, we were condemning the tyranny of the mites and their ongoing challenges against the rights of the human casualties and their contempt of laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary mind, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intency, and ruff and riff were the icon of the "Folot Age of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you with the success history of our failed and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to argue that we, as a nation, have made false choice and the wrong choices.
We've misguided our priorities.
Because elections didn't bring peace or peace to people or security in Lybia.
Does the appropriate and the change between female and male candidates have provided peace and national reconciliation?
No, it doesn't.
What's it?
Why is our society going to continue to polarize and dominate and dominate our society by selfish politics of dominance and the opposition, both men and women?
Maybe the women weren't the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the gnade and the dish.
Our society needs a national dialogue and institutionalization when it took the election, which has only strengthen the polarization and the fragmentation.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it takes the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We need to stop in the name of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to create a female discourse that is not only valid to the following values, but also to compensate: Gnade instead of revenge, cooperation rather than competition, rather than rejection.
These are the ideals that desperately need one of the broken lybies to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemy, and in this alchemia, it's about the overrover of feminine and masking views.
That's the real thing.
And we have to do that in existential ways before we do it sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam," peace" -- "is the word of the Good God, yell."
The word "raheem," again, known in all the late-raam traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "thun" -- "Lapp" and symbolically the mother's matal feminine, all around humanity, of the male and female and female, all the tribes that have died.
And just like the mother's assaulting the embryo that grows in him, fully occupied the basic posture of compassion is the existence of life.
So we were told, "My Gnade is going to keep all things up."
So we were told, "My Gnade, I was looking forward to my dow."
Let's all be the art of the gistle.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best place in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we were preparing the story of Kim Illung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
And although I often wondered how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until I had a change on everything.
When I was seven years old, I first saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I've never had to suffer hungry myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me from my mother, from my colleague's sister.
And it said, "If you were laughing at this, our five family members are not going to be in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground together, and our bodies are so weak that we're dying soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
And soon on that, I went through the station and I saw something horrible I can't delete from my memory.
A blind woman was lying on the ground, and a car-controlled child in her arm was looking helpless in his mother's face.
But nobody helped them because they were all concerned about caring for themselves and their families.
In the mid-10s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were sick of famine victims, and many others have only survived because they ate grass, beetles and tree cortex.
Officories became more and more common, so at night, everything was going to bother me, except the lights of China on the other side of the population that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and its neighbors at night.
This is the river of the internals, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river is very illuminating and enabled the North Koreans to escape.
But a lot of die.
Sometimes I saw some of the bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated from my family for a short time.
I never thought it took me 14 years to come back and live again.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like North Korean refugees, but I soon learned that it's not just very difficult, but it's also very dangerous, because North Korean refugees are seen as illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny of North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught up by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody was upset to me, North Koreans, so they tested my Chinese symptoms and asked me a lot of questions.
I was so scared, I thought my heart was explode.
If you were a dignity of anything unnatural, I could be imprisoned and signed up.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the survey, a senior officer said to the other, "That was a falcon.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are referring to foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught by Chinese police and signed up.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they eventually released out due to massive international pressures.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, there are countless Northern Koreans in China, and they are released to North Korea, where they tortured, imprisoned or publicly.
Although I was lucky at escape, there are many other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to struggle hard to survive.
After they've learned a new language and they've found work, their world can be replicated in a moment on their head.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea and again I started a new life.
I was leaving myself in Southern Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I've seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very divergent because of 67 years of the division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North Korean?
Where am I coming? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the Southern Korean life didn't fall easy, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording test for the university.
Just as I became more infected in my new life, I got a pretty shocking call.
The North Bronx authorities started to take the money that I sent my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to move around, to a remote place on the country.
They had to be as quick as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to take a huge distance back to the freedom they've made.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea, and ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I went to the north-Kore border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, to more than 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the expos<unk> of all the things, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand Chinese, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official told my family, I was determined, and he told him they were a little kid, and I was her boss.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to go up to the lavot border, but I had to almost look at my money to bribe the border reservations of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border crossing.
After I paid money and bribes, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was imprisoned, the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest disadvantages of my life.
I'd done everything I could to keep my family free, and we'd been so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Geographic message.
I went and I went from between the immigration department and the police department, and I was trying to desperately clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay back the bribe or cash providers.
I lost all my hopes.
And then I asked a man's voice, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised to think of a stranger.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and nostricted, he went to a bank machine, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And so I gave him a lot of heart and said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I'm not helping you," he answered.
"I help the North Carolina Indians help."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, for me, symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so desperately, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
After finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in Southern Korea, but the freedom is only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon as they get to a new country, they start with little or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, learning English, education, and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea change from inside.
I was so lucky to get as much help and inspiration in my life that I would be hopeful to succeed North Koreans with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, even on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is two2, and very well-looking.
He can't speak, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He's notices it, and he's discomforted, and he's disclaiming it.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, trying to make words that I don't even remember even, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely unfinished memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate cheeks, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations when he was four, while the first episode of the tecubbies on my arm was on my arm and a lady and Gagas's birthday.
Don't listen to it? It's not amazing?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that although this was the case, although they were not normally seen as usual, that only one could mean was extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "compism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and physical skill.
It's very different in every individual, and that's what Remi is different from the time that it's Sam.
And in the world, every 20 minutes, the person in autism is noticed, and although it's one of the fastest growing life disorders in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've been in autism, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was a lot of screaming.
He didn't want to play the way the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, and eating everything that was coming under him.
And as he got older, he became different, and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustles and the never ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any bias, a human being who never had otherwise been hurt.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments of what I wished was they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back with the thought about the things that they taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I understand that these are the things that I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Normality is the beauty that makes us differences, and the fact that we are different, doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be remarkable.
Because autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it, and all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate victims of potential.
The chance to be on scale, progress and change, at the moment when we try to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton was filled with awe and curiosity, with this photo on a project that filled a apple through a paper, and with a sausage time of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto-A photographer, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light into motion.
And so with that, we can build cameras that are looking out at corners of our view or can't see an <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we're doing with "mamera" my face.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I cut it in a billionth of a second -- this is several femone second -- I make a package of photons that are barely a millimeter, and this photon package, this project, this project, is moving at the speed of light -- and, as I said, a million times a day, a normal project.
So if you take this project, this photons package, and you shoot it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in slow motion?
So this whole event --
So remember, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- so long as the light to go back this lane -- but I'm going to try to get this video up to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse of our project, our projectill, starts to take a bottle with a photon pack, which starts to move through, and then breaks inside.
Part of the light is due to the outside of the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
A lot of photons are actually reached by the time to break the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that's suspended around the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on a number of images after the end.
Now, if you take a standard project and leave it back the same route and then slow the video back to the factor of 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the film?
A week? No, a year. No.
This is a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in motion.
And what about a little more still-time photograph?
You can see again, these waves are streaming down the table, which is streaming Toms and the wall in the background.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It seemed like nature is drawing a photo like this, a Femto image, but of course, our eye is a composed of individual image.
But if you look at this Tomva, you'll see that when the light is streaming over the Tomva, it's going to keep it apart. It's not going to be dark.
Why is this? Because Tom is bust, and the light jumps around you, and after a few billion seconds, it comes out.
So in the future, if this barto camera is embedded in your camera in your camera, it might be possible that you can go to a supermarket and find out if a fruit is closed, without touching it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you're taking a photo with a short-term of air, you have very little light, but we're more quickly than the shortest of the air, so you're not getting as good as you do.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons package, a multi-six, and we're drawing this over and over again with very clever synchrony synchrony, and we're combining these gigabytes of data to create this data, and we've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do some really interesting things with it.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future supercomputer: Can they see corners?
The idea is that we're going to shave a little light on our door.
It's being deflined, going into space, some of it is reflected back on the door, and finally back to the camera, and we could use these more magnification of the light.
And this is not science fiction. We've actually built it already.
On the left, you see our Femto truck.
Behind the wall is a soup hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications, it was taken out by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to release this light project, and they're going to push on this wall, and the photon packs are all over the way, and some of the photons will reach our hidden soup, which will then break the light, and then the door will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the photons of the photons will come back to the camera, but they'll be quite interesting at the time.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique capabilities.
It has a very good time-consuming solution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is, what's the distance.
So by taking a laser light up, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but then when we take a lot of these pictures, dozens of these images, and combine them, and try to analyze the different light cycle, then we can see the object hidden?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a lot to do with it before we can actually implement this from the lab, we could build cars that are preventing collisions and see what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous injury by looking at light that is being reflected through open windows, or we can build endcos, deep down the body, looking around the knees, and also see pelototopes.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, and that's why this really is a hot call for scientists to think about Femto photography, because a new imaging process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, the science has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we collected every time, not only the scientific process, but we can also create a new form of computer photography with paint camera, paint, time-thrill, and all of us can see the wave between the time.
But it's a little bit fun, too.
If you look at those waves under the bottle, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we, almost in light, have a strange effect, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly incredible.
The sequence that happens in the events in the world appear in a circuit sequence, so by using the context of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether photography is around corners, or is it possible for a new visualization to create medicine or new forms of exhibitions, since our invention, we've made all the data open and detail on our website, and hope that the Cheetators, the creative community, and the research community, we should stop showing ourselves that we should stop the megelixs on the next micro-dimensional microscope, the next-dimensional slides, the next-dimensional slides, the way to begin to
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with our fellow beings.
We don't meet every neighbor on the street so that a lot of deliberation doesn't go through, but we use the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers and valves and circles.
The projects are created from my questions, like how much rented my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying about each other?
How can we divide our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is distracted by the vast estress that has been dumped for hundreds of years of loving, gay, drunk and junior shadows. I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time someone never fails, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings are in the world, but it's also the city with most missing property in America.
I live near this house thinking about how I can make it go. And I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very loved.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratefulness for my life, and it made me clear about the things that I've been interested in in in in life now.
But it's hard to keep me in this view every day.
It's easy to lose your life at a time and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of the abandoned house into a huge blackboard and wrote with a treasure of the blankb, "If I die," I want to see anyone who can come, can take a piece of chalk, think about their lives and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it kept growing.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall.
"I want to die because I'm supposed to be sued for piracy."
"On me to die, I want to stand full-time on the International Pass line."
"I want to die. I want to sing for millions of people."
"On me to die, I want to plant a tree."
"I want to die. I want to live under the Web."
"I want to die. I want to keep it in my arms once."
"I'd like to die. I want to be somebody's cavalry."
"I want to die, I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people got me laugh, the wine and the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for meeting and thinking and thinking, and remember what's most important as we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've received hundreds of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a kit in the world, and now in countries like Kasazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to rise our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often stopped talking about death, or even thinking about death, but I have come to realize that the preparation on death is one of the things that strengthening the most.
And the idea of death is that we're taught about life.
Our common places are the best to show us as individuals and as communities, and with more opportunities, to share our hopes, our fears and stories, people around us can not only help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in doing something that's been done with a very elaborate math. It's a particularly interesting problem for anyone who's concerned about this, and that's because we're like business workers.
Nobody knows what we're actually doing.
So today I'm going to try and tell you what I'm doing.
Smams are one of the most human activity.
We're thrilled to look at the fistant ballet and the number of couples you'll see.
For a ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying extraordinary ability. That's what it does to my people who had met Janriides who was a ballet mind at the time.
Over the years, you've been doing a lot of progress in the treatment.
But nevertheless, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the most disastrous symptom of weakness, tremors, pearl and other things that cause this disease, so we need objective means to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to really know if there's a cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
Now, trouble is that there are no biomarkers for Parkinson's disease, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's available is this 20-minute test with neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical studies, it's never done. It's never been done.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a failed tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be expensive to have a hospital.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to look at the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all at least, virtual uselessness like my starter Rripling.
Here's a video of the vibrating vocal lobe.
This happens in a healthy state when someone is making speech sounds, we can look at us as a coherent ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we create sound, and we all have the genes for it. FoxP.
And like Ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn until it's learning.
By clicking, we can determine the position of the vibrating mood, and like the limb's limb is also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
In the lower term, you can see an example of irregular vocal delusions.
We see the same symptoms always.
True, weakness, hip, hipness.
The language is actually becoming more mature and fuzzy, and that's an example of a pianist.
Now, this effects can be minimal, sometimes even with digital microphones and precision analysis software, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now see where someone is in a crib between disease and health, just because of the clones.
How can these tests be measured with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologist.
So little. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are exactly exactly accurate. They're not conducted by experts.
So they can be done on their own.
They're very fast, they're at least 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something is extremely cheap, you can also use it in a great order.
And we can get to this amazing goals.
We can reduce logististic problems for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can achieve objective data by increasing observation.
We can do inexpensive mass care for clinical trials and have the first research to be viable for the entire population.
Now we have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now, today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're starting the Parkinson's scenario.
With Aculab and PatientLikeMe, we want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough output data for the purposes of these goals.
We have Rufn numbers that are freely accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Everybody with no Parkinson's disease can be called cheaply to leave video record for a few cents. I've heard the pleasure of having been at six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say, 10,000 people, can you say who is healthy and who isn't?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient has to be able to tell if the patient has to have Alzheimer's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be made until the end.
But we collect a huge database, in many ways, which is interesting, and these conditions are important because we are to exploit it, to see which markers are really the actual markers for Parkinson's disease.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is there?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he's done fantastic work -- has shown that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project to happen, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
That's what I call a improvement.
That means that people can call -- people can call the phone with the phone and do the test. People could call Parkinson's voice, take their voice so that their doctor can test the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live in Kenya in the southern border of Nairobi National Park.
In the background, you see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National National Park is just stuck in the south, which means that wildlife like zebras can leave the park anytime.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only bumble.
My tribe, the tribe of the Massai, believes that we would come together with our animals and our wildlife habitats of the sky, which is why our animals mean so much.
I've been learning to hate lions as a child.
Our warrior, His name, Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestry. They're also on this problem because of this.
and kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are just so few lions in Nairobi National Park.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for his father's cows. That's what it was for me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but it would help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept on.
I had a second idea. I was trying to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow's table.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they see the bird search and they go back, but the next time they come and they say, the thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I was listening to the Stall. I was walking around with a rapech in his hand, and this time the lions didn't catch up.
So lions fear light, and it moves.
I had an idea.
I was working in my room as a little boy all day, and I was actually taking the new radio of my mother, and the day, it almost took me over, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy call from a motorcycle, and it suggests if you want to turn on the right or the left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and turn the lights on.
This is a little pear of a broken flo lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is carrying the battery, which provides the battery, which is providing electricity to the action plant. I call it a transitation generator.
And the right action is blinking.
You can see that the pears are pointing outwards, because they come from there, the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are blinking, and the lions believe I'm going around the ruball, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been installed this at home, and since then we've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals on lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hyena or leops, and the lights also serve to keep elephants out of farms.
My invention helped me go to a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school has been engaged and helps fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there are no other ones, and I'm showing people how to use it.
A year ago, I only had a boy from the savanna who was cudding his cousin. I looked at airplanes about me and said, "I'm going to sit in a room!"
And here I am.
I was invited to meet a plane for my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to eat lions, but through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can share the lions together, page with the lions, without argument.
Ash<unk>n<unk>n. In my language, this means, I thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical innovations.
What's the next list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. A electroderic fence?
Yes, I know that electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yeah, I've tried it all the time, but I've given the attempt to go back because I got a blow.
At first, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to be feeding you every step of your meeting, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now, since I'm old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and I didn't do any of them.
There was no kind of director, no style, no prospect of shooting a picture. Not even the lighting was being taken.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story starts when I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture where I held my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were on the corner of 57th and 5ths.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this goes from.
When my daughter's third birthday came closer, my wife said, "Hey, why do you raise Sabina not go to New York and do a father-in-law turn to continue the ritual?"
At the time, we started asking for free-dried tourists to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to have a complete stranger and you're going to have your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody has ever been touched with our camera.
At the time, we didn't know how much of these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is a guy who was taken after 9<unk>11 weeks, and I had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a single-dist moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep the time in October for a week, and how we change ourselves from year to year, not only physically, but in everything.
Because whenever we're doing the same image, our view of time changes as time, as they always achieve new milestone, I can see the life with their eyes, how they deal with everything, and how they see it.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year.
So recently, while one of our trips, we went out and suddenly they were as if they were, and they were just like, they're going to see it on a red mark on a vetsuit that they had learned as a little kid, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old, that's where she was doing this.
She said she remembers her belly on her chest when she first saw the store for the first time.
And now she looks in New York for high schools, because she's really trying to study in New York.
And I was so curious: The most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in conscious memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not on a family photo.
I'm always the one who's doing the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with this image and don't you mind asking someone, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
