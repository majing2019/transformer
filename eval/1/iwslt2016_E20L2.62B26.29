When I was 11 years old, I was stabbed one morning by the sounds of the bright joy.
My father listened to his little, gray radio show the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy at what was actually quite unusual at the time, because the news was largely depressing.
He called, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father clearly very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
It's a real school.
The Taliban took power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
So I stayed up for five years as a boy, and I was commuting my older sister who was no longer allowed to go alone to a secret school.
Only so we could go to school.
Every day, we took a different path so no one could guess where we were going.
We hid our books into shopping bags so we'd just go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small living room.
It was mish in the winter, but in the summer it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we risked our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And over and over again, the class suddenly had to fall out for a week because the Taliban had been risking.
We were never sure how much they knew about us.
They were advising us?
Did they know where we live?
We were scared, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and valued as daughters.
My grandfather was ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote prisonman, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and was rejected by his father.
My mother was trained, but she was a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she was in retirement, just to transform our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see here -- was the first person in his family ever received an education.
For him, it was always clear that his children would be receiving education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of not sending his kids to school.
I still know that in the years of the Taliban, sometimes I was so frustrated by our lives, of the constantly fear and the perspective of immileness.
I had good joke to give up. But my father said, "Tommy, wait me. You can lose everything in your life.
Your money can be stolen. You can be displaced in the war from your house.
But one thing will remain with you: what's in this. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school fees, we're going to do that.
So -- do you still want to give up?"
Today, I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my older women have higher degree as a high degree, and if my family hadn't used so much for my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm standing here today as a proudly uniformly in the middle ofbury College.
And when I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he was complaining about sending his daughters to school, one of the first people to congratulate me.
He doesn't just cry for my graduate degree, but also to say that I was the first woman to be who drives him with the car through Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has even greater dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women education.
So I've been helping to build SOLA, the first and perhaps even a nonprofit for girls in Afghanistan, a country where school paper is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition to all of them to make opportunities to their own.
And watching her parents and fathers stand for her, as well as my parents then, despite all odds and opposite their lives.
So Ahmed, like Ahmed. This is not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
Just a month ago, his daughter and he was out on the route of SOLA in her village, and they were out of death by a bomb on the side of the road just a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rang and a voice threatened him if he sent his daughter to school, she would try again.
He said, "Well, now I'm going to let you, but I'm not going to put my daughter's future because of your old and over-reational ideas."
In terms of Afghanistan, I've often realized something that is often deflated in the West: In the end of most of us who have succeeded, there is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and realizes that their success is also also success.
That's not to say that our mothers are not important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are becoming reasonably informed to their daughters' future, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
The Taliban were only a few hundred girls at school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be the same from America, so different.
Americans see how unsafe these changes are.
I suspect that the changes are not on the length, and they are changing all over the U.S. groups.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents, who are helping them, they're encouraging, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities, and every day the girls visited the SOLA.
It's the way I have big dreams.
Thank you.
Everything I do, including living, my life, was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, I don't -- I've worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the projects of engineering with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs failed.
I was desperate.
I thought 21 years ago we were Italian, and we were very good at doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we found.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, at Zambezi, was one where we were trying to show the people of Italy to be the local food.
We came to Southeast South Zambia with this blunt valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local community to cultivate Italian tomatoes and to Anchini.
Of course, the local authorities had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no agricultural farming in this fertile valley.
But instead of asking why they didn't set up anything, we said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Pear time to save the people of Sambias before the starvation."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this magnificent tomato tomato tomato. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, just how agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red, over night, about 200 nilocks were released from the river and grappled everything.
We said to the Hebrew, "Oh God, the nilperper!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought we were Italian, so we were so brave in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French was doing, and then I saw what they were doing, and then I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We ate, at least, the niliest.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we have not delivered the restless African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a busy economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money did.
Just read her book.
Check out about a African man who did what we've done.
We are Western people, imperialists, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We patronize them, or we are patriarchical.
Both words are from the Latin root, "pater," which means "Vater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every culture of another culture as if they're my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisative: I suffer each other's culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people are called "bwana," the boss.
I was greeted when I read the book "Swall" by singing. He said, most of the economic development, when people don't want help, they leave them alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is respect.
And this morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolous?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to react only to human beings, and I invented a system called business promotion, where no one is ever being launched, no one's ever motivated, but you're going to become the service of the local courage, the local people, the dream of becoming a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouths.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We're not working by offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in cafes.
We have no infrastructure.
We close friendships and we find out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can convey an idea of someone.
If that person doesn't like that, what do you do?
The urgency of your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own growing up is the most important thing in human race.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because no one can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this case: Why not in a community, not in a community, telling people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me give you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You know, entrepreneurs never participate, and they never will say publicly what they want to do with their money, what are the possibilities they're looking at.
You want to try and make a blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know, because they never appear to be public meeting.
We work one to do this, we need to be made a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It has to be created for a new job.
This is the local servant of the company, the local department of the company, who sits with you in the house, at your kitchen table and in the cafe, helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way to move life.
I tried this in section, West Antarctica.
I tweaked at the time, and I tried to get out the raging flaws where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets for the first year, and within three days, I had my first client. And I helped him with a fish in a garage, he was Maori. And I helped him sell him to a restaurant in Perth, and then he came to the fishermen and said, "You helped the Maori. Can you help us?
I helped these five fishers work together and not sell this amazing tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million dollars, but to Japan sushi for 15 dollars. And then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them? Can you help us?
I had 27 projects in one year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do <unk> I said, "I'm doing something very, very hard.
I'm holding the mouth and I'm listening to them."
So <unk> So the government says, "Let's do it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been helping 40,000 companies in founding this.
There's a new generation of companies that are going on loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business advisors in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's printers was a philosophy professor before he was working with companies. Peter's printer said, "Cetship is really incompatible with a social society and economics."
Design is the death of entrepreneurship.
So you build Christchurch, without knowing what the smartest man Christchurchens want to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to come to be overstated.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
For what presentation did you most have liked tomorrow?
<unk>Sear, passionate people. You applaud that.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the irreversible fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freon Art of Environment is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way, transport them, and can correspond to them.
The technologies don't exist for it.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Forget it.
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it right now.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York in 1860s.
In 1860 they came together and they were re-programd, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was a myth: The New York City would no longer exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, as the population continues at that speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to deal with the shit of six million horses.
Because they were already under the crap.
In 1860 they see the dirty technology that makes life out of New York.
What happens? Forty years later, in 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were little factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered discretionion.
They don't come and talk to you.
Next, you have to give them absolute, dedicated and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
Of the smallest and biggest company, all of you have to be able to perform three things: that must be grand-comprietary, that must be grand market market contract, and the financial authorities must be huge.
What is it?
We never met a single person who is simultaneously producing something, selling and caring for money.
That's not the case.
This person was never born.
We did research and we looked at the 100 iystiest companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that's just a successful company in the world, one thing that's founded: no one of them only was founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-olds in Northland entrepreneurship, and we start teaching them the class, and we're going to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons Autography, and the next 16 year's job is to support two sides of Richard Bransons National Geographic's autobiography, how often he uses the word "we" and how often the word "we."
Never "me" and 32 times we go.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, who has a small corporate background, sit in cafeteria and bars, and they're working with their dedicated buddies, who are going to do what someone who has done for this gentleman who talks about this epus, somebody will tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate entrepreneurs to help them find the resources and people, and we've found that the wonder of the health of the local population can be transformed by the culture and the economy of that community, just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned what it must be like to be Alice in Wonderland.
The Penn State University asked me -- a grant for communications -- asking engineers to communicate in communication.
I was afraid.
Really right. Fearful of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big, not familiar words.
But when talking came to him, it was like Alice, when she was pushing down to the case of a pighole and saw a door in a whole new world.
And just like that, I felt when I was talking to the students, and I was amazed by the thoughts they had, and I wanted others to discover this wonder of this wonder.
I think to open up those door, it requires great communication.
We need great communications from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are addressing our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know anything about it, and it's not going forward. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-dististist, to look for these conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to happen when our scientists and engineers don't invite us to their miraculous country.
So scientists and engineers, please, sit up.
So I want to show you a couple of attempts about how you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is, what?
Tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
It's not just that our body monitors are examining, but it's also telling us that their stomachs, the cellular structure in our bones, are examining, because it's important to understand and treat ooporosis.
And if you describe what you're doing, then you're using useless speech.
Now, arguments are a barrier to understanding your mind.
Sure, your tidy-down could use it in time and time, but why don't you just say "space and time," what's much more intuitive to us?
And we're trying to understand our minds, not the same as the same as the lighting down the ground.
As Einstein said, "Bew things as easily as possible -- not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific area without having to tradeoffs.
Now, a few things to consider: examples, stories and analogies. So you can draw us into your closet.
And when you present your work, the dots go away.
Have you ever asked why it's called "up point"?
What happens when someone comes to mind? Another one is taken to the first time, and the first of those dots is your audience.
Now, a slide like this is not just boring, but it also very much set up on the talk-processing part of our brains, and we're getting into a very fast-term.
This is an example of Genevieve Brown, which is much more effective, and it shows that the specific structure of the body is so stable that it was actually the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy letter where the audience is once they lose the thread, and they're using images and graphics that are also appealing to our other senses, and thereby building a deeper understanding of what they're describing.
These are just a few attempts that help us open up those towers and see the wonders of the country that compares science and technology.
Since the engineers I've been taught to do a little bit with the "Names in me" -- I want to sum up everything with an equation.
So if you look at your science, you look at your check points, and your stuff, you're sharing them through the relevance, so the audience is important, and multiply the whole thing with your passion, which is your incredible work, and it's making possible interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I was mainly comfortable with it.
Thank you.
Hi. This is my phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom.
You can do a cell phone with a crime in human Syria.
You can tweet a phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And with a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get high-fetched on sound cloud cloud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1984 living in Berlin.
Let's go back to that time in this town.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the streets and demonstrated.
We are in the fall of 1989, wondering that all of these people who were coming and asking change had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how my life has changed.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines are full of information.
Tump data.
And why are these information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.S. embassy has set up a policy.
This is a policy called the Department of Foreign Progressure Act.
And that policy is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service provider in Europe, needs to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who sends an email to whom?
Who is sending a text message?
And when you use a cell phone, where you're,
All of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your phone company or your Internet service.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up there and they said, "We don't want to."
They said we don't want to have this sanctuary protection.
We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service service to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, all of them said, "We don't want to do that."
And you can see here how tens of thousands of people were streaming down the streets of Berlin and saying, "Runness instead of fear."
And some even said that could be at Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Limpolizei in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering, is it really working?
Can the real information about us waste?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using it?
So I asked my phone company, the German Tele-com, who was then the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked her, please, send me all the information that got laid down on me.
And I asked her once, and I asked her again, and I didn't get the right answer. Just the lower blue bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening there.
So I decided to put a legal court on it, because I wanted this information.
But the German Tele-com said no, we're not going to give you that information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to get back to the counter, which is what they're all asking me to send all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court trial decided that the E.U. embassy was a legal violation in German.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And on the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
First, I saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. I'm moving.
But then I realized after a while, this is my life.
That's six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what am I going to start with?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is called the supply of care.
So with time online and open data City, I did this.
This is a visualization of about six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, you can browse and up.
You can take every step I do, track it.
And you can even see me driving from Frankfurt with the train to get oil, and like many phone calls I'm doing around the way.
And all of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
First of all, I'm just calling my wife, and she calls me up, and we're talking to each other a few times.
And then a couple of friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you shout at you, and you're calling, and we have this huge communication network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all this.
You can see the central figures, like, who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a construction plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society because you know who talks to whom to send an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we imagine that all these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1982 had cell phones in their pockets.
And the Stasi would have known who was in the demonstration, and if the Asas knew who the leader was, that might never happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall wouldn't have happened.
And then, again, the case of the iron of the curtain.
Because today, the government agencies and companies today want to store so many information, how they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight every day.
So when you go home, you tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
If you go home, you're talking about your foreignman just because companies and government areas have the ability to store specific information, they don't have to do it long yet.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they've saved you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight the self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the visceral criminal, the rapid-diving restaurants, the Brak Space.
So the city planers meet and they thought about changing the name of South Central so that it represents something else, they changed it in South Los Angeles as if it was something that changes what's wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
Feken shops, rapid-diving restaurants, Brak Space.
So like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food desert South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drivehrus and the Drivebys.
The weird thing is that the Drivehrus kills more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central L.A. in a curable condition.
For example, obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't really appreciate that anymore.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, see the negative effects that the food system has on your neighborhood?
I dream that skier chairs were bought and sold like use of use trucks.
I see dialogue centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that it has to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't really like to have a little bit of a 45-minute meeting to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's 45 to three meters.
The thing is, it's part of the city.
But you have to nurture it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to be able to do it."
And I decided to hold it in.
So I and my group, the L.A. Green Grates, and we started planting my food hot and fruit trees, and plant wood trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We're a kind of a pre-medit, connected by gardening all the social strips and all the city, and it's completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and he basically handed me a vet, and said I had to remove my garden, the charge was a predatory order.
And I thought, "Well, come on, right?
a narrative about growing food on a piece of land that you're totally not care about?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her to do this."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez did a story about it, and with a community of Green Ground, they signed a petition on Chord.org, and we succeeded with 900 signatures.
We kept the victory in the hands.
My townmate even called and told me that they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
L.A. has most of the garage spaces in the United States.
They own 67 miles of cash space.
This is 20 Central Park.
That's enough area to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell shouldn't they find that OK?
By planting a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get a dollar worth of fruit and vegetables for 75 dollars.
It's my marriage, I tell people to grow their own food.
Pliving its own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
And I refuse to be part of this pre-made reality that's made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
"Corting is my graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist who's piling walls, I'm going to keep lawns and parking lots.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my tribute to this stuff.
You'd be surprised to use it as a canvas, anything that can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced my backyard becoming an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the soil.
They would wonder how children are influenced by it.
and gardening is the most arctic and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
And you get strawberry straw.
I remember that time that mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 at night. They were in my backyard, and I came out and looked at her like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the end of the road."
I've been ashamed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and it just empowered me to do that. People asked me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Oh hell, no, I'm not afraid they're squeaking.
It's on the street.
So that's the idea.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to take care of your health."
On another time, I put a garden in this homeless home in Downtown L.A.
These are the guys who helped me to buy the laster.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how it devastated them with her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, even though it was only for a moment.
Green grassblues have planted about 20 gardens.
And we had 50 people in our retrofites, and they all came together with volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they're not shown to affect food minds and bodies, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are exactly on the path that they were looking for, and they don't go anywhere else.
The gardening, I see, as a chance, where we can train these kids to care for their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could produce the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant a whole neighborhood of gardens where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take shipping container and turn it into healthy cafe blocks.
So don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking free free, because free is not sustainable.
The weird thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and having them experience the joy, the pride and the honor when you're building your own food, and when you open up farmers' markets.
So what I'm going to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangster, gangster gardening.
We have to turn the image of the gang sky around.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You know, you're going to be a puppeteer, right?
And let the gun be your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me up if you want to sit down in these crazy chairs and make a meeting where you're talking about doing some jokes.
If you want to meet me, come with your skier, in my backyard so we can plant any scastry.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in Oxford is the dictionary "snollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And it's "nollygoster" means "a-articulate politicians."
Although in the 19th century, a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Snollygaster is someone who plays a office regardless of side, program or commandment, and his success by the pure power of the aristonic deconiality."
I have no idea what "taking" is.
Something to say, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
So for example, 1771, according to the British Parliament, the newspapers were not awarded the exact word "dollunched" of the debates.
And that actually went back to the guts of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who was following Parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they bred it, but he was courageous enough to pray, to counter, and eventually he had so much support in London that he would win.
And just a few years later, we're going to find the first test for the sentence "so strong like Brass." A lot of people think.
Brass all turns into the English word for lead.
But that's not true. It's all about a convicted of the freedom of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the United States at the time when it just got to independence.
And you would see the question of, how do you call George Washington, the head of state,
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
And it's been discussed for an infinite number of years in Congress.
And there were all kinds of possible suggestions about this.
I mean, some people wanted to call him the Governor Washington, and others, his high-valess George Washington, and again, other people's legislative freedom of the people in the United States of America.
Not so exhilarating.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought it was worth it.
They were not monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was bored with this incredible job because this debate was three weeks old.
I read the journal book of a senator who always writes, "Wait the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the boredom was that the House of Representatives was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a good. They didn't want to.
King, and maybe even give him an idea of his success.
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most pathetic titles, the most terrifying titles that they could find.
This is a cover.
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only believed that someone had a gathering.
Something like a pre-pording party.
He had no longer the size of the record as "written" or "aater."
Sometimes there were small president of different colonial groups and government groups, but it was really an unconceential title.
That's why the Senate refused him.
They said, "That's ridiculous. You can't call him president.
This guy has to sign the contract and meet foreign puppies.
Who will take him seriously when he has a stupid little title like the president of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate had not been there.
Instead, we were not going to be using the term "tellor," but they were totally unaware of the fact that they were not meant to be honest with the opinion and the institutions of civilians, whether it's in Republic or monarchy, where it's the office of the head of state respectfulion -- not necessarily the president and the other.
You can learn three interesting things from it.
First, and I find that the best -- until now I have no idea whether the Senate has ever confirmed the president as well.
Barack Obama, President Obama, has just called the title. He just waits for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government says something temporary -- you're waiting for 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, is that the title "Sountor of America" is not so humbling now, right?
That has more than 5,000 nuclear strawheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and history have given the title of size.
And so the Senate eventually won.
You've got a respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the emaus of self-hood -- well, it was.
But you know how many nations there are, how did a president have?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost because no one feels humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'll leave that with.
Politicians are trying to use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality of words is much more than words could ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a truck with about 50 rebellion on the fight for dalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I made my black Conmarain's foot gloves against a pair of brown leather motels and fired a rocket towards the government authorities I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I'd been raised with the war, but next to Pyjama parties and football plays and commissions with racist South countries and non-distical protesters who live with communism and living for a lifetime, and trying to capture grazing events before I knew what that was.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I stand here, I'm here, I'm a society-ereating South nations of God Gaden, an atheist and a radical political artist who's been working in Afghanistan for the last nine years.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could make about art, but I personally don't like rainbows. I want to make art that draws personality and commanding authority and rewriting reality and rewriting the reality and even the kind of creative people in trying to understand the world that we live in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the one that's doing jihad activists on their own system like "Popstar blare" and used armed religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can do to the jihad first, as a Republican will do for the presidency and make a choice campaign with the slogan, "Pear me! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And try to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi to spend on being a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan on the bottom, with a project called "Rapeing," where you're going to be a policeman, build a false control site on the streets of Kabul and keep cars, but instead of taking bribes from them, providing money and giving them money in the name of Kabul police in Afghanistan. And they hope that they trust the 100 percent of us.
I want to look at how the conflict in Afghanistan has become the world-regific conflict.
The war and the stranger who came with him, created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I put together a local family support with several people, or a reprowered vet in a fashionual super-friendly vigrative work.
And I'd like to see what a simple poiling of Kabul looks like between 1899 Appell to create a dialogue about the current development institutions of their origins in the past colonial rhetoric about the White man's chief to protect themselves and maybe even a little bit of civilized.
But for all these things, you can get to jail, they can misunderstood, misrepresented misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and I've been working for a while since I've been a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel like I was in this room now building an uncomfortable tension, because I shouldn't have been attached to this dress.
Fortunately, I have a little bit to change with it.
This is the first time someone is meditating around the TED stage, so you can appreciate what you're happy to see.
If some women were really upset when I came out, you don't need me to say this later I'll read you on Twitter.
I also realize that I'm pretty privileged, because I can change 10 seconds in a very short way, what you're thinking of me.
Nobody has the chance to do that.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head, because then you're going to do anything, so you don't do it until it's over my head.
All right.
So why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it was not as embarrassing as this image, I hope.
A image is powerful, but a visual is also super-simplified.
I've just completely changed your mind in six seconds.
And in this picture -- I never really had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to use my back to put my back and hold my hand into the hair of this guy.
And besides the surgery or the wrong traw that I had to devote myself to work two days ago, there's very few ways of changing our utterance, and our utterance -- even though it's super-ficial and irreducible -- a huge impact on our lives.
Fear is to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people are always asking me, but in the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I'm always saying, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is made of.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, where admiration is biologically programmed, but also as big, crusty and brightest.
This legacy was created for me, and it is a legacy that was being paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some fashion lawyers like, "Horthr. Naomi, Tyra Smak. Lih.
And first, I'm going to comment on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the run, each of which was being booked, and that 677 modules were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that's always being asked me is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown up?"
And first of all, I say, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give is, "Why?
You know what? You can get everything.
You can become President of the United States, or the creator of the next Internet, or a Ninja heart surgeon, which would be completely insane, because if you were the first one."
And if you go back to this great counter, you still say, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who the boss."
Because I don't have a responsibility for anything, and you could be the president of the American bird, or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel.
To say that you're going to be a model later, like you're going to say you're going to want to get the Jacket in the Lotto.
You can't do it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career path.
Now I'd like to show you 10 years of a tech model, because it's not as a heart surgeon, it's just now unfolding.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the client says, "Cameron, we'd like to run a picture," now the leg goes nice, and long, that arm goes back to the back, that arm is on the back, and you just move back to three inches, and you'll see that, 300 times, maybe, 16 times your friends, you'd have imagined.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish school and you've done a lot of jobs, unfortunately, you can't say much. If you want to be president of the United States, but in life, "10 years of underwear," you're going to be looking at weird.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is saving all the photos?"
And yes, pretty much all the photos are being cleaned up, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and this was the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my period.
I know that's going to be quite personal now, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a few months before, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of the day.
My girlfriend had to come and join me.
This is me on a Pyjama party a couple days before a Shooting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the V magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these images are not mine.
They're constructors, and they're designed by a group of professionals, Hairstylists and make-up artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and their post-program. They're programming. That's not me.
Okay, so the next thing people always ask me is, "Kattle, do you do things for nothing?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-square-foot-patching shoes that I can never wear except, but the things that I get free are things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I had forgotten my money, and they gave me the dress for free.
So when I was a teenager, I was driving with my girlfriend, a terrible driver, and she was walking over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It took you, "Excuse me, Mr. Winner, and we were able to go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance, and I didn't have people who are paying for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and I live in 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and filtered last year, 85 percent black and Latino are mostly young men.
It lives in New York only 17,000 young black and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Am I stopping?"
It was, "How often am I being stopped? When I'm stopped?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I have is, "What is it like to be a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer: "If you're a little bit thinner and shiny hair, then you feel very happy and wonderful."
And backstage, we're going to give a response that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never tell in front of the camera, which I never said before in front of the camera is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsure because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Would I have happier if I had little legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet some modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most bright hair and the most cool rubber chamels, and they are because of their appearance, probably, the most uncertain women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a role-class, because I felt really uncomfortable about putting myself up here and saying, "I got all the benefits of a stack that were being bent into my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to add, "And it never always makes me happy."
It was very difficult to unconcury a legacy of gender and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I find it great that I've done this here before 10 or 20 years of last, and my career has been more fulfilled, because I probably wouldn't tell you how I got my first job, or I wouldn't be saying it, and I wouldn't be saying like college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope we all recognize the power of the image in our misreadable failures and misconceptions.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, gaddafafi resistance. Celebrate him.
But never, I'm never going to be a Gaddafi revolution.
It's been now almost two years since the Libyan revolution, inspired by the waves of mass operations both in the Tunisian and the Egyptian Revolution.
I joined a lot of other Libyans, in and out of the other Libyens, to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gothaffis.
And there she was, a big revolution.
Boy, Libby women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice stopped.
They proved excellent courage by asking for the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
You've shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east to the distant west, to the South.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutally war, and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and overrovvert the tyranny.
But Gaddafi left a huge criminal justice event, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for change.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed the regulation of infrastructure, and the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I rented as many other women to rebuild the civil society of Lybia. We challenged a participatory and legitimate transition to democracy and national function.
Oahe to 200 organizations were founded while and immediately after Gaddafis was founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started to organize workshops to the issues of capacity, human development and leadership skills.
So with a wonderful group of women, I started the peacebuilding platform for Libyters, a movement of women, leaders of different lifestyle, whose goal is to enter public for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to prepare for our right to equal responsibility in democracy and peacebuilding.
And I was meeting in the elections, and I was meeting a very difficult environment, a community that was more polarized, a environment that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and impairment.
I led a initiative to the peacebuilding platform of Libyters to achieve a sovereign choice, a law that any citizen, no matter what backgrounds it should be, the right to vote and run, and mainly for political parties, a convergence between male and female, on the vertical, straight and solid on the horizontal level, and to make a challenge.
At the end, our initiative was taken and succeeded.
Women won 17.5 percent of the national justice in the first elections since 52 years.
But by a way, the euphoria of elections and the whole revolution for the whole year, because every day we were committing new messages of violence.
And a morning, we applied to the marriage of the ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
On another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack to the message.
Then, on another morning, the murder of police were signed up by the army.
And really, every day, we're committing to the tyrants and their ongoing imperatives against the human rights of prisoners and their deficiation of laws and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary mentalism, polarized and removed from the ideals and principles, freedom, dignity, social justice -- that they were at the beginning.
Intolerance, impunation and revenge became the icon of the Folian era of the revolution.
I'm not there today to inspire you to be the success story of our failed and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that as a nation, we've made the wrong choice and the wrong choices.
We misguved our priorities.
Because elections didn't bring peace nor stability or safety in Lybia.
Has the appropriate and the change between female and male candidates brought peace and national refurbation?
No, it doesn't.
So what is it?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate our society by selfish politics of dominance and impending, both men and women?
Maybe women were not the only ones that missed it, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the percane.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus when it took the elections, which has only strengthened polarization and depletion.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female rather than it needs the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop acting in the name of anger and demand a day of revenge.
We have to start acting in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We have to develop a female discourse that not only pre-mowers the values, but also compares: Gnotade, instead of revenge, cooperation, rather than competition, rather than incurringing.
These are the ideals that desperately need a raging of war to achieve peace.
Because peace has alchemy, and in that alchemia, it's all about the overroval of feminine and masking views.
That's the real confusion.
And we have to do that in existential ways before we do it as a sociopolitical thing.
After a verse from the <unk>Salam<unk> <unk> peace<unk> <unk> "is the word of the Good God, falshew."
The word "rahere," again, which is known in all of the post-raous traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "rahem" and symbolized "in mother's residious feminine, all around humanity, of the male and the female and the female, all of whom have run all the tribes and all of them.
And just like the mother's assurance, which grows in him, all around the main body of compassion is the same for all of its existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is going to include all things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has prelimited from my grall."
Let's all of us be the art of the Gittade.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best place in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
So in school, we took the story of Kim Illung, but we didn't learn much about the world outside, except America, South Korea and Japan are our enemies.
Although often I wondered what the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until a whole changing time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public contraction for the first time, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I had never had to suffer from starvation.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter from a colleague's sister's sister.
It said, "If you guys are sitting in this, our five family members will not be here in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're all on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country.
Shortly after that, I went down the station and saw something horrible I can't delete from my memory.
A blind woman was lying on the floor, and a carved kid in her arm looked helplessly in her mother's face.
But no one helped them because they were all so busy caring about themselves and their families.
In the mid-19950s, there was a huge famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were eaten to victims, and many others survived because they ate grass, beetles and trees.
Offic crashes became more and more common, so at night, all the lights of China on the other side of the popular record that we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amroc, which is partly supported as border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very vigilous, and it enables North Koreans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China to the far-distant relatives.
I just thought I was going to be apart for a short time from my family.
I never thought it took 14 years to revise.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl with no family.
I didn't have an idea of what life would be like North Korean refugees, but I soon learned that it's not only very difficult, but also very dangerous. Because North Korean refugees are seen in China as illegal immigrants.
So I lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny after North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was realized when I was caught by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody sued me to be the North Koreans, so they test my Chinese knowledges and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought my heart would explode.
So, dignity appearing unnatural, I could be imprisoned and reposed.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the question, a senior officer said to the other, "That was a false failure.
She's not a North Korean woman."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are being captured by foreign messages called Asyl, but many are captured by the Chinese police and registered.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they were caught, they finally released very, very high international pressures.
These North Koreans were not very lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught and they are dumped in China after North Korea, where they're tortured, imprisoned or publicly-organized.
Although I was lucky in flight, there's not much other North Koreans.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identity and fight hard to survive.
After she's learned a new language and found work, the world can be put on her head in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was down in South Korea, a greater challenge than I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start learning my third language.
And also, I saw the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside we've been very divergent, because of 67 years of division.
I was walking through an identity crisis.
Am I South or North American?
Where am I coming? Who am I?
Suddenly, no more land that my home could have been.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life did not fall, I had a plan.
I prepared for the recording test for university.
Just by being used to my new life, I got a very shocking call.
The North Bronx authorities started throwing the money I sent my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to reshape in a remote place in the country.
They had to run as quickly as possible, so I started planning their flight.
North Koreans have to take an incredible route to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and ironically, I took a flight back to China, and made me go to the North Korean border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to run them, over 2,000 miles across China and then Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got caught almost several times.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the expos<unk> of all of them, and he started asking questions.
And because my family didn't understand a Chinese family, I thought they were going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official called my family, I agreed and told him they were gay, and I was their congressive.
He looked at me defyly, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to make it to the la la la la la la lav border, but I had to almost clean up my money to bribe the borderline of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was imprisoned, because of illegal border resolution.
After I paid money sentence and a bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
That was one of the biggest dissection of my life.
I had done everything I could to protect my family to freedom, and we were so close, but my family was arrested just before the Southern Geographic message.
And I went and forth between the immigration department and the police department, trying desperately to liberate my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay back bribes or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was completely surprised to think of a stranger.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation, and without stalking it to a bank mechanic, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
And I thank him about the whole heart, and I said, "Why do you help me?"
"I don't hire you," he answered.
"I help the north Streetan people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, for me, symbolized a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope to need the North Koreans.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom was only one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they get to a new country, they start with little or no money at all.
The international community can help us learn in education, learn English, education and many more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still have access to family services, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea to change from inside.
I was fortunate enough to get so much help and inspiration in my life, that I would like to make hope to succeed North Koreans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans all over the world, also on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'll just give you one request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good-looking.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't speak.
Remi knows what love is.
He shares them unconditionarily, and he gives them no attention.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the skin color.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine that he never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, trying to make words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: How little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16th, he's big. He's very good-looking.
He has an absolutely impossible memory.
He also has an selective one.
He can't remember if he was stolen my chocolate man, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first episode of the teapbubies on my arm was on my arm and Gagas's birthday.
Don't they listen to me?
But a lot of people are not right.
And in fact, because their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they're often over and understood correctly.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that although that was the case, even though they were not normal, that only one could mean was extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communication, learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's reflected in every individual, so Remi is so different from Sam.
And worldwide is that every 20 minutes of autism is noticed, and even though it's one of the fastest growing organisms in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've met autism, but I can't remember it without any day.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He cried a lot.
He didn't want to play the same way that the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran into his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a row of space, putting the washing machine and eating everything that came out of him.
And as he got older, he became different, and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the frustility and the silent hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who never lied.
Remarkably remarkable.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments I wished that they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize these are things I wouldn't want to interact against normality.
Normality is the beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You're going to be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in them. And all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifices of potential.
The chance to be large, progress and change is dying in the moment we're trying to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has faked us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph on a project of a robotic pad, and with a sense of a half-thousth-thurity time, a millionth-century.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to give you a new kind of photography, the Femto-A photographer, a new technology that's so fast that it can create time-lapse images of light moving.
And so we can build cameras that can look out of our view as we look outside the corner, or we can't see an <unk>-ray in our body and really ask what we mean with "mouse" in our body.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I turn it into a billionth of a second -- this is several femtoseconds -- I create a package of photons that hardly a millimeter wide, and this photon package of these photos, this project will move to light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a normal project.
So if you take this projectill, this photons package, and you shoot it in that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What is the light that looks like in slow motion?
So, this whole event, you know.
So, remember, the whole event actually takes less than a nanotone -- so long as you have to go back this lane -- but I'm going to try to highlight this video to the factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola did not fund this research.
So, in this movie, a lot of things happen, so let me analyze this and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon package that starts to move through, and eventually breaks in.
Part of the light is flowing out of the table, and you see the spread of waves.
Many of these photons eventually achieve the dissection of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble in the bottle hanging around.
And meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you can see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images at the end of the bottle.
Now, if you're taking a general project and you're going to take it back the same route, and you slow that video up by 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
One day, one week? No, a whole year.
That would be a very boring movie -- of a slow, normal projectal movement.
And what about a little more still-diving photographer?
You can see again, these waves go to the table, flipping Tomate and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It appeared to me as if nature drew a photo, a Femto image, but of course, our eye looks a compartmentalized picture.
But if you look at this Tomats again, you'll see that when the lights are flashing the Tom Beats, they're going to keep going, they're not going to be getting any better.
Why is that? Because the Tomats is turned, and the light jumps around you, and after a few hundred billion seconds, it's coming out.
So in the future, if this tapto truck is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you can go to a supermarket and find out if you're a fruit, if you're on the ground, you're not going to touch it.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you took a photo of a short-term of air, you have very little light, but we're pushing a billion times faster than your shortest calves, so you're not getting as good as light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon package, a million times, and we're drawing this again and using very clever synchrony synchrony data, and we're combining this gigabytes of data to make this Femto video that I've just shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but what about a new superpower for a future supercompoene: To see corners?
The idea is that we light on the door.
It's going to be crushing, going into the space, bouncing back up a part of it, and eventually back to the camera, and we could use these more magnifory routes of light.
And this is not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left you see our Femto Camera.
Behind the wall is a soup hidden, and we're going to let the light go on the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to nail that light project, and they're going to push that wall, and this photons package will be all the way up, and some of the photons will be able to break our hidden soup, and then they'll then recap the light, and then they'll reflect a part of the broken light and a tiny percentage of photons, and then they'll come back to the most interesting place in the moment, and they'll be
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our FemtoL camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what point is.
So by making a laser light, we can take a pipe image that looks like you see on the screen -- doesn't really make sense, but then when we take a lot of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-subing process, then we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our engineering.
We have a little bit more work to do before we can do this in the lab, we could build cars that avoid collisions, and see what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous liver injuries by looking at the light that's open windows, or we can build endcosak around the body in the right powder and also see Kcotopes.
But because of the blood pressure and tissue, that's obviously very challenging, and that's really a wake-up call for scientists to now think about Femto's photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, like Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, science has become an art, an art of ultra-speed photography, and I realized that all of these gigabytes of data that we collect every time we use, not only a scientific image, we can also create a new form of computer photography with paint captureings, with paint absorbs, and we can only remember that wave between time.
But it also happens to something fun here.
If you look at these waves under the bottleneck, you can see the waves are moving away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What's going on?
It turns out that we're almost at the speed of light, we're almost in the speed of light, weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this image.
The order of events in the world is appearing in reverse order, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct these biases.
So, no matter whether photography is around corners or creating a new visualization tool for medicine or new exhibits since we've been able to open all the data and detail on our website and hope that the Spiderakers, the creative community, we should stop showing us that we should stop the megabyte of cameras, the next time, the next time we're trying to make the next data and the next one, to be able to start to re-scale.
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with other people.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so that a lot of deliberation doesn't go through, but we use the same public spaces.
I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the last few years using things like stickers and damons and chalks.
The projects came from my questions, like how much rentes pay my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without complaining to each other?
How can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for the unmanned houses so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being defounded by the vast shirts that have been giving love and sweat and sweat and trauma and shade. I trust a city where there are always music.
I think every time someone ever thinks there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most abandoned property in America.
I live near this house thinking about how I could make it more, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother. Her death suddenly came and unexpectedly.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratefulness for my life, and it made me realize what the things that I'm now important in life.
But it's hard to hold that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I transformed a side of the house into a huge blackboard and wrote with a treasure of the gaps: "On me to die ..." I want everybody to come, I can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public place.
I wasn't sure what I could expect to do with the experiment, but the next day the wall was completely crowded, and it kept growing.
I want to share some sentences that are written by the people on the wall.
"I want to die. I want to be accused of piracy."
"On me to die, I want to be on a broad-time basis on the International World Cup."
"Wait me to die. I want to sing for millions of people."
"I'd like to die. I'd like to plant a tree."
"I want to die." I want to live "connected."
"I want to die, I want to hold it in my arms again."
"On me to die, I want to be somebody who's cavalry."
"I want to die. I want to be all myself."
This neglected place became a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to laugh, to the wine and to the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for finding and thinking, and seeing what's most important as we grow and changing.
I did this last year, and I got hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I built a kit in the world, and now they built a building in countries like Kazan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces when we have the opportunity to up our voices and share more with others.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of increase distractions, it's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and delicate.
We're often being stopped talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that preparation is one of the things that strengthen most of us.
And the idea of death is how we think life is so much to us.
Our common spaces are the best to show us as individuals and as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes, fears and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in dedicated mathematics. I'm a particularly special problem for anyone who's engaged in disgusted mathematics is that we're like business consultants.
Nobody knows what we're doing.
So today, I'm going to try to explain what I'm doing.
And dancing is one of the most human activity.
We're excited about the black-up ballet and the number of tosses as you'll see.
So the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge and skill, and it may be a fundamental determination that a genetic component might have.
Sadly, neurologic disturbances like Parkinson's slowly destroy this extraordinary ability. It also makes it possible with my fellow Jan Stri Interpling, who was a ballogen moment in time.
Over the years, you've been doing a lot of progress in treatment.
And yet, there are 6.3 million people who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the impairable symptoms like weakness, tremor, abality and other things that cause this disease, so we need objective means to discover the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's a cure, if we have an objective metric to answer that question.
Now, trouble is that there's no biomarkers on Parkinson's and other body disorders, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing to do is to have this 20-minute test with neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never done. It's never been done.
But what if patients could do that test at home?
That would save a trained tour to the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't take a very expensive hospital personnel.
It costs 300 percent to go into the neurological department.
So I want to propose to you a unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all, in a certain sense, virtual uselesss like my me, Janri epite.
Here you see a video of vibrating voice sounds.
This is what happens in a healthy state when someone is creating a voice sound, and we can look at the moody ballet dancer, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sound, and we all have the genes for it, FoxP2, for example.
And like Ballet, it requires an enormous amount of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to learn to talk.
And by the loud, we can actually define the position of vibrating vocal sounds, and just like the limbs are also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
You can see, on the bottom of the record, there's an example of irregular vocal delusion.
We always see the same symptoms.
True, weakness, weakness, eality.
The language becomes even more wiser and more colorful, and that's an example of the amptomy.
Now, the effects of the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and precision disorder analysis software, combined with new machine learning that's now very advanced, we can now tell where someone is in a space between disease and health, just because of the sounds of the vocal.
How can these tests be measured with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
So little, the infrastructure is already there.
You don't have to build new clinics for it.
And both are exactly exactly the same. They're not doing the right test for experts.
So they can be conducted on their own.
They're very fast, they're at 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If there's something extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large scale.
And we can do these amazing goals.
We can reduce logistical difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through conventional observation.
We can do inexpensive mass recruitments for clinical trials, and we're going to have a research for the whole population to be viable.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's voice-recitiative.
With an Aculab and PatientsikeMe, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough input data for the success of these goals.
We have Rufn numbers that are freely accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Everybody with or without Parkinson's disease can be called cheap to leave images for a few cents. I'm known to be fun that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, we're going to say, well, we can ask 10,000 people who's healthy and who's not.
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What's happened is that the patient in the phone call must have to tell if that person is suffering Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them might not be possible to end.
But we collect a huge database, in different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are actually to exploit them to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's.
At the moment, their 86 percent accuracy is there?
It's much better.
My students Thanasis -- I have to praise him because he did this amazing work -- has shown that it works on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
So people can call them the phone, they can call them the test, they could call them Parkinson's disease, they can take their voice so that their doctor could check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you very much. Max Pink, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of Nairobi National Park.
In the back, you see the cows of my father, and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Boston National Park is only in the South, so that means wildlife like Zebras can leave the park any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them. And then they do this.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found her dead. It was terrible. It was our only bore.
My tribe, the colony of the Maasa, believes that we're coming together with our animals and our wildlife habitats of the sky, which is why our animals matter so much.
I've learned to hate lions ever as a child.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our tribe and our ancestry. They're also on this problem.
and they kill the lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think there are just so few lions in Nairobi national parks.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for his father's cows. That's what it was for me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. Bears are afraid of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but help the lions to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried a bird's search.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You come, you see the bird search and you go again. The next time they come and they say, this thing doesn't move, it's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I shook the stub. I walked around with a torch around him, and this time the lions didn't interrupt.
An lion fear light that moves.
I had an idea.
Even as a little boy, I worked all day in my room, and once again I took the new radio of my mom, and the day almost took me around. But I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy call from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn right or left. It's blinking.
And I made a switch to turn the lights off and turn the lights on.
This is a little pear of a broken flashlight.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is actually putting the battery, which is providing electricity to the correct system. I'll call it a transformer.
And the right is to blink up.
You can see that the sins are pointing outwards, because they come from there to the lions.
And this is what the lions look like when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions think I'm going around the rubble, and I've been in bed all the time.
Thank you.
I've been doing this at home, and since then we've had no trouble talking to lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She had lost a lot of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used throughout Kenya, including other predators, or hymen, or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep elephants remotely away.
My invention helped me a scholarship at one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and is helping fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we put the lights where there's no one, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
A year ago, I only had a boy from the savanna who was coughing his father. I saw airplanes over me and said, "I'm going to sit in one of the other days!"
And here I am.
and I had to draw a plane for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to eat lions. But through my invention, I can save my father's cows and we can do it together, side by side with lions, without argument.
Ash<unk> Ol<unk>n. In my language, I'm very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical inventions.
What's next on the list?
So my next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. A electrode fence?
Yeah, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it before, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've been stopped because I got -- a blow.
First of all, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you every step of your web, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to hold a camera in my hand, and I've got photography, I've got my passion, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and none of them have done it.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no way to shoot a picture. Not even the lighting was taken.
And to be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story started when I was a speaking in New York, and my wife made this picture where I hold my daughter at her first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57thster and five.
And just a year later, we went back to New York, and we decided to shoot the same image again.
Well, you can see where this goes out ...
When my daughter's third birthday came up and said, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do a father-in-law turn to continue the ritual?"
So we started asking, by the way, to go through the street tourists, to take a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're giving a complete stranger a camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, no one has ever been touched with our camera.
And then we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These images are much more than just a coincidence moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep time in October for a week, and how we change the year and how we change, not only physically, but in everything.
Because although we always take the same picture, our view of time changes as it's reached new milestones, I can see life with their eyes as they interact with everything and how it sees.
This very intense time we spend on each other is something that we value and expect every year.
Lastly, while one of our travel, we went for a walk, and all of a sudden they were going, it's on a red mark on a grapeet, which they had learned as a little kid, at the previous travels.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five year-old at that point.
She said that she remembered her heart breaking out of the chest when she first saw the store for nine years ago.
And now she looks at high school schools because she's really trying to study it in New York.
And I realized, obviously, the most important thing that we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in informed memory experiences.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at very much a family photo.
I'm always the one who does the picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come up with the image and don't tell someone to ask, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you very much.
BLEU = 26.29, 57.3/33.8/21.6/14.0 (BP=0.951, ration=0.952)
