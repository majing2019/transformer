When I was 11 years old, I was just a day of time being filled by the sounds of the bundles.
My father listened to his little, gray radio show at the BBC's news show.
He looked very happy, which was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly depressed by the news.
He said, "The Taliban are gone!"
I didn't know what that meant, but it made my father obviously very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
A real school.
The Taliban were taking the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they were banned to go to school.
So I was storing for five years as a boy and dedicated my older sister who couldn't go alone to a secret school.
Only we could go to school.
Every day, we took another way, so nobody could guess where we went.
We are hiding our books in shopping bags so it looked like we're just going to go shopping.
We were put in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was a shame in the winter, but in the summer, it was incredibly hot.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And again, the lesson had to be lost for a week, because the Taliban had been swallowed.
We never really knew how much they knew about us.
They were advised us?
Did they know where we live?
We were afraid, but we still wanted to go to school.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was important and girls were valued.
My grandfather had been far ahead of his time.
A foreign minister from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and he was violated for his father.
My mother-in-dipped mother, but I became a teacher.
That's her.
Two years ago, she went to retire, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father -- to see -- here was the first thing in his family ever received an education.
And to him, it was always clear that his children would get an education, even his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
He saw it as a much larger risk of not sending his kids to school.
I still know that in the years, I was sometimes so frustrated by the Taliban, and I was so frustrated by the still fear and the interrelability of the world.
I had good fun not to give up. But my dad said, "Tommy, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can get rid of your money. You can get rid of your house in war.
But one thing that will keep you: what's in this room. And even if we have to pay our blood to your school payments, we're going to do that.
So -- you still want to give up?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have higher degree than the junior degree, and if my family didn't have been used so much to my education, I would also be one of those women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudly uniformly of the Grandbury College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was violated by his family, because he agreed to send his daughters to school, one of the first people to congratulate me.
He's not just that he's graduating my college, but also to say that I was the first woman who's driving him through the car in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign for women's education.
So I've been helping to start the SOLA, the first and perhaps even the only curriculum for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school-sollar is still risky.
It's wonderful to see students in my school, with great ambition, all of them want to see opportunities.
And see their parents and fathers, as they stand for them, as well as my parents, despite all the odds of the worse.
Like Ahmed. That's not his real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed is the father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he was out on the way home from SOLA to her village, and they were out of the death through a bomb on the side just a few minutes.
When he got to the house, the phone rang and a voice threatened to get him to school, if he was sending his daughter to school, they would try again.
He said, "I'm going to kill you now, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter in the game because of your old and over-towning ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've discovered something that often is being rejected in the West: the majority of us who are succeed, is a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and who is aware that their success is also.
That's not to say that our mothers are not going to be important in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are beginning to be very compelling and persuasive to their little-standing future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is essential.
And the Taliban were just a few hundred girls going to school -- because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, over three million girls are pushing the bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so it's not.
Americans recognize how insecure these changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes are not long-range and the development of the U.S. troops are changing everything.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school, and their parents who are using them, they're encouraging them, I see a promising future and a long-lasting change.
Afghanistan is for me a country of hope and the unfinished possibilities, and every day, the girls who visit the SOLA.
They have big dreams, just like me.
Thank you.
Everything I do, even as I'm working -- my life was coined by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
From 1971 to 1977, I see young, but I don't -- I've been working in Zambia, Kenya, I've been working with the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia on the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NRO, and every single project we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I thought, 21 years, we're an Italian-good, and we're very good at doing good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we first measured.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Ripples" by the Zambezi, was one where we wanted to show people of the Muslim who wanted to be built by food.
We came to Italian forest seeds in South Zambia, into this disengage valley, which leads to Sambesi River. We trained the local population to grow Italian tomatoes and Anchini.
Of course, the staff had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they came up.
We were amazed that there was no such thing to be agricultural.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we said, "Thank God we're here!"
"Pait time to save the people of Sambias before the star."
Of course, everything was wonderful in Africa.
We had these gorgeous tomatoatoes. In Italy, they got so big, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, how easy agriculture is."
When the tomatoatoes were red and red, over night, over 200 nibels were coming out of the river and they're doing everything.
We said to the Sambers, "Oh God, the mortal!"
And they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
"Why didn't you say that?" "You never asked us."
I just thought, we were Italian, so we were so brave in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the French people were doing, and after I saw what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
We were at least feeding the mortal.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense we didn't have, the restless African people.
You should read the book "Dead Aid" by Dambisa Moyo, she's a joint economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We've given the African continent and 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has done.
Just read their book.
So think about a African woman, what we've done.
We are Western people, colonialists, missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people. We colonize them, or we are patriarchal.
Both words are from the Latin root, which means "pater."
But they have two different meanings.
patriarchal: I treat every culture that I have, as if they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronisisative: I suffer every other culture as if they were my servant.
That's why white people in Africa are called the boss.
I was teased when I read the book "mallall" by the Beautiful. He said, most of the economic engineering, if people don't want to help, they leave them.
This should be the first principle of the help.
The first principle of aid is respect.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and asked, "Can you imagine a city that's not neocolatic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I invented a system called a company that never started to get a job, never gets motivated, but you're going to become the local passion, the local servant of the people who have the dream to be a better person.
What you do -- you hold your mouth.
You never get a community with ideas, you sit down with the local people.
We're not working by offices.
We're in cafes. We're in cafes. We're in kneipes.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're closing up friends and finding out what the person wants.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't like what you're supposed to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important thing.
The passion for your own growing is the most important thing for humanity.
We're helping them find the knowledge, because nobody can be successful alone.
The person who may not have the idea, but it's available.
Many years ago, I had this trap: Why not to get into a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
entrepreneurs never participate, and they will never say publicly what they want to do with their money, what they see for opportunities.
You have this blind spot.
The smartest people in the community don't know because they never appear to be a public meeting.
We're working with one to do that, we need to be produced by social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
It's a new job that needs to be created.
This is the company's hospital, the hospitalist of the company, who's sitting in the house with you, at your kitchen table and the cafe, helps you find the tools to transform your passion in a way of transforming life.
I tried this in solidarity, West Australia,
I was preparing for the time, trying to escape the flushing, where we tell others what to do.
And so I was walking around the streets in the first year, and I was able to get my first three days of customers. And I helped him get fish in a garage, he was Maori. I helped him sell a restaurant in Perth, and then the fishermen came to the street and said, "You had the Maori help us."
I helped these five fishers to work together and sell this amazing tuna to a factory in Albany for 60 cents per million dollars, but to Japan for a 40-dollar-dollar-dollar-dollar-handa-a-half. Then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them?" Can you help us?"
I had been walking for 27 projects in a year. The government came to ask me, "How do you do that?
How do you do ?" I said, "I'm doing something very, very difficult.
I hold the mouth and I listen to them."
So -- So the government says, "Let me put it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've helped 40,000 companies in the founding.
There's a new generation of companies that go into loneliness.
Peter's printer, one of the best business leaders in history, died with 96 years ago.
Peter's a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter's printer said, "Rake is really un-united with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Plan is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christchurch, and you don't know what the smartest man Christchurch wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get them to get you.
You have to provide them discourse and privacy. You have to be great at helping them, and they're going to get divorced.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, the intelligence and passion?
For what presentation you've been most applauding tomorrow?
"Sit, passionate people. You've been clapping.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the deceptive fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden there are systems that are not sustainable.
Automatic combustion engine is not sustainable.
The Freonyp of the Convention is not sustainable.
We need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, build, transport, and then we can correspond to them.
The technologies are not there.
Who is going to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? You forget.
The government? Forget it!
It's going to be entrepreneurs. And they're already doing it.
I read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to talk about the future of New York in 1860.
In 1860 they came together and they were speculative, which would happen in 100 years with the city of New York, and the conclusion was that the city of New York would no longer exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, if the population grows at this speed, they needed six million horses to kill people, and it would be impossible to get done with the dung of six million horses.
Because they'd already go under the crap.
And they see 1860 the dirty technology that's eating life from New York.
What happens? Forty years later, 1900, there were 1001 automotive companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding another technology had made the race. There were tiny factories in the back of the country.
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to be offered discourse.
They don't come to them and talk to you.
Next, you have to provide them absolute, committed and passionate service.
And then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the biggest company, all have to be able to do three things: to sell the product, to be grand, to be the market market market, to be great, and to be a massive amount of finance.
You know what?
We never met one person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
That's not what's happening.
This person never was born.
We did research, and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have, only one thing that's founded by one person.
Now we teach 16-year-old entrepreneurship in North Korea, and we start teaching them to give them the first two sides of Richard Bransons autobiography. The job is 16 students, to support the first two sides of Richard Bransons autobiography, as often as they use the word "I'm," and often how the word "weeds."
Never "I" and 32 times we are.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody founded a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create a community where the facilitator, who has a small entrepreneur background, sit in cafeteria and bars, and they're the people who are going to do what someone for this gentleman who's been doing for this vague, somebody talks about this. Somebody's going to tell you, "What do you need?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't." "Do you want me to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support corporate organization to help them find the tools and people, and we've found that the wonders of the intelligence of the local population are going to change the culture and the economy, only by starting to capture the passion and energy and imagination of their people.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I've learned how it should be, to be Alice in the miracle countryside.
And Penn State University asked me -- a tutor for communications -- to give training engineers into communication.
I was scared.
I'm really afraid. In front of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, I'm not trusting words.
But when the conversation evolved, it was like Alice, when she was driving down to the canary beer and saw a door in a whole new world.
And just as I felt, when I was talking to the students, I was amazed by the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this wonder land.
To open this door, I think, we need great communications.
We need some great communications from our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are going to tackle our biggest problems, like energy, environmental and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go anywhere. I think it's in our responsibility as a non-obist, to look for those conversations.
But these great conversations are not going to come when our scientists and engineers aren't going to invite us to their wonderful lands.
So scientists and engineers, please, we'll be on the table.
So I want to show you some of the ways that you can do it, that we can see that the science and the technology that you're doing with, sexy and exciting.
The first question you have to answer is: Okay, so what?
Does this tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us.
Not only do you know that their clothes are studying, but also tell us that their clothes, their plastic structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat oopoprosis.
And if you describe what you do, then you'll have to write out the paper.
Now, the word-written is a barrier to understanding your thoughts.
Sure, you could use your tidy-up and time-life, but why don't you just say "Spaces and time," what's a lot more intuitive to us?
And to understand our thoughts, it's not the same as to cut down their level.
As Einstein already said, "Take things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell us something about your scientific territory without having to deal with tradeoffs.
A couple of things about this is that there are examples, stories and analogies, and that's how you can pull us into your cheer.
And if you present your work, you'll take away the spots.
Have you ever asked why it's called "reverse"?
What happens when someone gets to mind? Another one is going to be stabged, and those dots are the first ones you're in.
A slide like this is not just boring, but it also goes too much to the very popular work-making part of our brain, and that's why we're quickly challenged.
This example of Genevieber Brown is much more powerful. It shows that the specific structure of the worm is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a single, easy, playful sentence where the audience, once it's going to lose the thread, and it's calculating images and graphics that are also going to engage our other senses, and therefore creates a deeper understanding of what it is that they describe.
These are just a couple of the attempts that can help us open up these door and see the wonders land that are spreading science and technology.
Because the engineers I've been teaching, I've taught them to make the <unk>the hotel in me seamlessly, I want to sum up all the way with the equation.
So if you look at your science and your articles, you can share them through the relevance, which is the audience what's important, and multiply the passion that you have for your incredible work. And that's what makes you more unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm really excited about it.
Thank you.
Hi. That's my cell phone.
A cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom to it.
You can actually film a drug in human race in Syria.
You can tweak a phone with a cell phone and start a protest in Egypt.
And you can take a cell phone, you can take a song, you can get it on soundoud and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Let's go back to that city at that time.
You can see hundreds of thousands of people going to the streets and demonstrated.
We've been in the fall of 1989, and we imagine that all of these people who are coming and asking change have had a cell phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone in it?
Hold it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep them up!
Keep it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost every cell phone today.
But today, I want to talk about my cell phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
This is 35.830 lines full of information.
Fules.
And why are this information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U.S. embassy has set out a right line.
This is called a policy line for the protection of the protection.
And that's a policy that every telephone company in Europe has to store any Internet service administrator in Europe, has to store a range of user information.
Who calls? Who sends an email?
Who is going to send a text message?
And when you use a cell phone, you use where you are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months from your phone company or your Internet service company.
And everywhere in Europe, people have come up and said, "We don't want to do that."
They said, we don't want to have this fiscal supply.
We want to have self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone companies and Internet services to store all of that information about us.
There were lawyers, lawyers, priests, all of them said, "We don't want to do that."
And you can see how tens of thousands of people were streaming down the streets of Berlin and saying, "Freedom instead of fear."
And some of them even said this could be at Stasi 2.0.
The Stasi was the Lumleimpolizei in eastern Germany.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can the really information about us?
Every time I use my cell phone, I'm using it?
So I asked my phone company, the German Teleject, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, I'm going to send all the information you've saved over me.
And I once asked her, and I asked her again, and I couldn't get the right answer. Just make any more fresh blue Bla Bla.
But then I said, I want to have this information, because it's my life that's been happening with it.
So I decided to put a trial against it, because I wanted to have that information.
But the counter-clone said no, we're not going to give you that information.
And at the end, it was compared to them.
I'm going to take back to the delusion of what they're all trying to get me all the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal court trial decided that the introduction of the E.U. Senate was the case of law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown strip with a CD.
And the CD was this.
35830 lines of information.
I first saw it, and I said to myself, well, it's a huge file. My hand.
But then I realized, after a while, this is my life.
This is six months of my life in this file.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start with this?
Because you see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to the public with this information.
I want to make them published.
Because I want to show people what is protective control.
So with time online and open data City, I've done this.
This is a visualizing of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, you can go back and forth.
You can take every step that I do, track.
And you can even see, I'm driving from Frankfurt with the train to get to K<unk>nn, and how many calls I'm going to run.
All of this is possible by this information.
It makes a little bit of anxiety.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I'm calling my wife, and she calls me, and we're talking to each other a couple of times.
And then a couple of friends call me up, and they call each other.
And after a while, you call up, and you call up, and we have this huge communications network.
But you can see how people communicate with each other, how they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see all that.
You can see the central figures, like who are the leaders of the group.
If you have access to that information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to that information, you can control society.
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design of how to monitor a society, because you know who talks to who is talking to who is sending an email, all of this is possible if you have access to that information.
And that information is stored for at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I first said, let's imagine that all of these people in the streets of Berlins in the fall of 1989, had cell phones in their pocket.
And the Stasi would have known who was at the demonstration, and if the Stasi knew who the leaders were, that might not have happened.
The fall of the Berlin wall might not have happened.
And anyway, the case of the icy curtain was not the case.
Because today, the government agencies and companies today want to store so much information, as they can get over us, online and offline.
They want to be able to track our lives, and they want to store it in a long time.
But self-determination and a life in the digital age are not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-determination today.
They have to fight for this every day.
So if you go home, tell your friends that privacy is an important value of the 21st century, and that's not old.
If you go home, you're saying to yourself, just because companies and government places have the ability to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company for the information they've stored over you.
So, in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember that you have to fight your self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
I live in South Central.
This is South Central: the temporary, rapid-diving restaurants, Brakk.
So the town map is coming together, and they're thinking about changing the name of South Central so that he's standing for something else, she's changing it in South Los Angeles, as if something changes what's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
So, locals, rapid-diving restaurants, bureaucect spaces.
Like 26,6 million Americans, I live in the food desert in South Central Los Angeles, the home of the Drive-bhrus and the Drivebys.
The thing about this is that the Drivehrus kill more people than the Drivebys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in the most unpredictable conditions.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than at Beverly Hills, about 15 kilometers away.
I couldn't see that anymore.
And I wondered how you would feel if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, see the negative effects that the existing food system has on your neighborhood.
I've been able to make sure that skier chairs are bought and sold like use.
I see a lot of dialysis centers rolling up like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what we need to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and food is the solution.
And I didn't feel like I was a little bit of a 45-minute meeting to get an apple that's not mediated with pesticides.
So I planted a food heat in front of my house.
It's a piece of land we call a park park.
It's about 45 feet.
The thing is, it's heard of the city.
But you have to nurture.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want, because it's my responsibility, and I have to be in charge."
And I decided to keep it in the way.
So I got to my group, the L.A. Green Grips, and we started to plant my food park and fruit trees, the whole program, the vegetables.
We're a kind of a pre-performance group, put together by gardening from all the social layers and all the city, and it's completely free, and all we're doing is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then someone complained.
The city came to me, and he basically shared me a carrier, and he said I had to remove my garden, the carrier became a connotation.
And I thought, "Yeah, yeah?
Give us a narrative of how to grow food in a piece of land that you're totally not sure?"
And I thought, "Cool. Her her."
Because this time, it wouldn't go.
The L.A. Times got wind of it. Steve Lopez made a story about it, and he talked to the city bank, and with a member of Green Ground, and they signed a petition on Change.org, and we succeeded with 900 regulations.
We thought we were going to be the victory in the hands.
My townmate even called up and said they support it and love what we do.
So really, why shouldn't they do that?
LA. In the United States, most of the palades in the property of the city.
They have 67-mile-half feet in Brakkall.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough land to plant 725 million tomatoes.
Why the hell don't want them to be able to find OK?
Through the crops of a plant, you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables at 75 dollars in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my funeral, I'm telling people that they should be growing their own food.
To make your own food is like printing your own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up. I raised my sons there.
And I'm more ashamed to be part of these pre-conceived reality that's made by other people, and I'm making my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
Sorticulture is my graffiti. I'm putting my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, a wall-breating, I'm going to make lawns and park spaces.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees are my favorite of these stuff.
You would be surprised by what the grounds of the Earth can do if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how it touches people.
So what happened?
I've experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the ground.
You would wonder how children are affected by it.
and gardeners are the most therapeutic and courageous act you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get strawberry strawberries.
I remember that time that this mother and her daughter came, it was about 10:30 the night. They were in my garden, and I got out, and they looked like this.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I told them, "You know, you don't have to do that.
The garden is not the way it's on the street.
I've been ashamed when I saw people who were so close and hungry, and that's just what it's empowered to do. People were asking me, "Fin, you're not afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aum hell, no, I'm not afraid they're squeaking.
It's on the street.
That's the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take care of their health."
I put a garden in this homeless home in the Sowntown L.A.
These are the guys that helped me to get out of the truck.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how it's spawned with her mother and her grandmother, and it was amazing to see how it changed, even for a moment.
Green grassves have already planted about 20 gardens.
And we went to our retro-plests, and we got 50 people and we did it, and these are all volunteers.
When kids grow carbon, children eat carbon.
When they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes.
But if they don't get anything from that, if they don't get shown how food and body affects, they're blind, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they stick in this thing -- I see colored kids who are just on the path that they were looking for, and they won't go anywhere.
I see the gardeners as an opportunity, where we can train these kids to take care of their communities to lead sustainable lives.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we're never going to do that.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do that.
I want to plant an entire residential gardening area where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take shipbacks and turn it into healthy cafe.
So, don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snuck, because free is not sustainable.
The point of sustainability is that you have to stay through it.
I'm talking about giving people work and getting kids out of the streets, and letting them experience the pride and the honor when you build your own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is make this sexy.
I want us to become all the ecological rebels, gangs, gangs, goohers.
We need to turn the picture of the ganglight.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a gangster.
You're going to be a puppet, right?
And let's get the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me when you're going to sit in smart chairs and want to make a meeting where you're talking about doing any jokes.
If you want to meet me, you come with your skier, in my backyard, so we can plant any scissors.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
One of my favorite words in the entire Oxford English dictionary is "nollygoster."
Because it sounds so nice.
And it's "nnnollyjoster" means "the unsent politicians."
Although in the 19th century a newspaper publisher gave a better definition: "A Monollygoster is someone who is planning a post, independent of party, program or commandment, and his success is achieved by the pure acoustic acronym.
I have no idea what the toy is.
Something with words, I think.
But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control the language.
So for example, 1771, the British Parliament were allowed to get to the very simple word "write" of the debates.
And that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who went back to the parliament.
They threw it in the Tower of London, and they gave it a little bit of courage, and he was brave enough to refine, and he ended up going to get so much support in London that he won.
And only a few years later, we find the first confession for the sentence "so" is strong, like Brassass."
And then, you know, the word for the word is ticking.
But that's not true. It's a convicted failure of the freedom of the press.
But to show you how words and politics are intertwined, I want to take you to the U.S. at the time that it's just reached independence.
And you would see the question of, how to call George Washington, the head of the head.
You didn't know.
What is called the leader of a universal nation?
There's been an accidental debate in Congress for an infinite amount.
And there were all kinds of extrapolements.
I mean, some people wanted to call him Governor Washington, and others, his high-value George Washington, and again, other people's legislative of freedom of the people in the United States of Washington.
It's not that sensitive.
Some people just wanted to name him king.
They thought that that was a good thing to do.
They weren't monarchististic, they wanted to choose the king for a particular period of time.
It could have worked.
But everybody was an awkward bored, because that debate stopped three weeks.
I read the journal the journal of a senator who constantly wrote, "I'm still going to have the same topic."
The reason for the delay, and the funness was that the Representatives house was against the Senate.
The Representatives of the House did not want Washington to be worthy. They didn't want to.
King call it, and maybe even give it to ideas about it,
They wanted to give him the most humbling, most kind of, the most horrifying title that they could think of.
This title was "Pountor."
President. They didn't invent the title. He existed before. But he only meant that someone was being bitten by a collection.
Like the precautionary of a jury.
He had no longer the size of the term "written" or "talk water."
Sometimes there were some little prime-scale presidents who were involved in government groups, but it was really an unobtrone title.
That's why the Senate refused to release it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him the President.
This guy has to sign the contract and meet foreign bribe.
Who's going to take him seriously if he's got a stupid little title like President of the United States of America?"
And after three weeks of debate, the Senate had not stopped.
Instead, we didn't think of the word "the Prince" claim, but they were absolutely, really, really, that they were not agreed for their honest respect for the opinions and the institutions of civilized nations, whether it's in the Republic or monarchy, where it's wetdocene, that the director of the state is assertive -- not to the people who are the foreignist of the nations.
You can learn interesting things from that.
First, and I think that's the best I can't find -- until now I can't figure out if the Senate ever officially validated the President.
Barack Obama, President Obama, just loved the title. He's just waiting for the Senate to be active.
Second, you can learn that if a government tells you that something temporary -- you're waiting 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important thing, is that the title of the United States today is not so humbling, right?
That's something more than 5,000 nuclear strawberries that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet drones and all that stuff.
Reality and story have given the size.
And that's how the Senate ended.
They got an respectful title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the emaided of self-serness -- well, that's how it was.
But you know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like this guy with 5,000 nuclear bombs and so forth.
So at the end, the Senate and the representative house lost because no one feels kind of humbling when you're told you're now the president of the United States.
And that's the most important thing you can take away with, and I'm going to leave you with that.
Politicians are using words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, the reality changes much more than words that the words might ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I got to a truck with about 50 rebellors on the fight of Naalalabad -- a 19-year-old, vegetarian surfers of Jacksonville, Florida.
I would be yelling my black Conmarhlock against a couple brown leather-hell and wrestled a rocket towards the government's path that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
For a long time, I had become big at war, but next to Pyjama parties and football games at Samens and commits with racist South-distian demonstrations and the non-religious demonstrations that the never lived with communism and Afghanistan for long, and also to consider corrections before I knew what I knew.
But that's the geography of the self.
And so I'm standing here, I'm here, I'm a committed, I'm a-in-evoler, I'm a South-states of God's Gnsen, and I'm a very, very, very, very democratic artist who's been working for the last nine years in Afghanistan.
So, there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do about art, but I personally don't like to paint rainbows. I want to make art that draws people's personalities and challenges and references them to the reality and even use a kind of a kind of creative record to try and understand the world that we're in.
I want to spend a day in a jihad -- the one that causes its jihad to be a conservationist like "Popstar" and used religious harassment and political corruption to enrich.
And what else can do the jihad first, as the parliament should do and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Am I going to do! I do jihad and I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to allow these mafiosi to be used as a national hero.
I want to go to Afghanistan's corruption, and I want to go to the bottom, with a project called "Rape," where you give yourself a cop to build a false control station on the streets of Kabul and keep cars and cars, but instead of providing money to them, and in the name of the police in Kabul, and I hope that they will be the 100 percent chance that they would be safe.
I want to look at what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, in my opinion, in the Intercational conflict.
The war and the strange views that came with him have created a new environment for Style and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers in which I combine local-owned coat clothes with a protected or multiple resetpassed vets in a neocococococococococococococ.
And I'd like to see what a simple pointer from Kabul looks like in 181 Appell's app to create a dialogue about today's development-in-an-an-an-an-stated nature of the past colonial rhetoric of the White Man to protect the brown man from themselves and even to defend them a little bit of their own.
But for all of these things, you can get to prison, you can be misunderstood, you can't get misrepresented.
But I do it because I have to, because the geography of the self demands it.
That's my burden. What's your weight?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for some time I've been working as a model.
For 10 years, exactly.
I feel like I've built a uncomfortable tension here in this room, because I shouldn't have been able to wear this dress.
Fortunately, I'm going to have another way to turn it on.
This is the first time someone pulls himself on the TED stage, so you can appreciate happiness, you can see that.
If some of the women were really cheating when I came out, you don't need me to say this later, I read it to Twitter.
I'm also sure I'm pretty privileged, because I can change in a very short 10 seconds what you think of.
Nobody has the chance to do that.
These rejections are very uncomfortable, and it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull out the sweater over my head, because then you're going to wake me all, you're not doing anything, as long as it's above my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
That was embarrassing.
Now, it's not that I hope it's not that uncomfortable as this picture.
A picture is powerful, but a picture is also superficial.
I just changed my mind in six seconds.
And this is a picture -- I never really had a friend of mine.
I was very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should throw my back and put my hand into the hair of this guy.
And apart from the surgery or the wrong thing that I've been able to do for the work two days ago, there's very few ways to change our utterance, and that's because it's super-simportible and ineffective -- a big impact on our lives.
Being uncomfortable for me today is to be honest.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and in my business, we call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to try to answer the questions that people are always asking me, but in the most honest way.
The first question is, "How do you make a model?"
I say, "Oh, I've been discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic lottery and an important legacy, and maybe ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have defined beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, in the way that we're compatible with it, but also as big, sharp, feminist and brightest.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been paid for me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this, and maybe some fashion-in-duty people might call them, "Halt. Naomi, Tyrazy. Liu."
And first I'm going to comment on your model of knowledge. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU counted all the modules on the length, each one that was consumed, and that 677 modules were only 27 or less than four percent.
The next question that I'm asked is, "Can I be a model if I'm grown?"
And I say to you, "I don't know, that's not my responsibility."
But the second answer I want to say is, I want to really give these little girls, is, why?
You know what? You can get anything.
You can become President President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a Ninja-style surgeon, which would be completely wrong, because then you'd be the first one."
If you go through this amazing counter, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who my boss."
Because I don't have any responsibility for anything, and you could be the editor of the American bird or the CEO of H<unk>amp;M or the next Steven Meelel.
And to say that you want to be a model later, it's like saying you want to get the Jacket in the lottery.
You can't make it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I want to show you 10 years of a model of knowledge, because otherwise, as a heart surgeon, it can only escape.
If there's a photographer, and the light is right there, like a nice beam, and the customer says, "Cameron, we want a picture to run." And now the leg goes first, beautiful, long, long, that arm goes back to the back, you're on the head, you're on three-quarters, and you just move back, and you can see that, you'll see, 300 times your friends are newborn.
It looks something like this.
Hopefully less strange than that in the middle.
That was -- I don't know what happened there.
If you finish the school and have a little bit of a life and have some jobs, you can't say much more. If you say you want to be President President of the United States, but in the lifetime, "10 years of underwear," you'll be able to see it.
The next question that's often asked me is, "Who is saving all the photos?"
And yes, as much as all of these photos are stored, but that's just a small part of what happened.
This is the first photo I've ever done, and that's also the first time I was wearing a Bikini. I didn't even have my period.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I saw just a few months earlier, with my grandmother.
This is me the day of this shoot.
My friend had to come to me.
This is me at a Pyjama party, a couple days before a Shooting for the French bird.
This is me with the football team and the New Yorker magazine.
And that's me today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures are not pictures of me.
They're constructing, and they're a group of professionals, Hairstylists and makeable artists and photographers and Stylithists and all their assistants and the pre-program deployment. They're not me.
Okay, so next, when people ask me, "You're doing things for free?"
Yeah, I have too many 20-cunk shoes that I can't wear, except even the things I get free, things that I get in real life and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and one day I went to a store and I forgot my money, and I gave the dress for free.
As a teenager, I drove with my friend, a terrible driver, and she took over a red light, and of course we were stopped. It just took me, "Excuse me, Mr. Winnermeister," and we could go on.
I got these free things because of my appearance and there are people who are not paying for their appearance and not because of their personality.
I live in New York, and we have 140,000 teenagers who have been stopped and filtered last year, 85 percent black and Latino and most young men.
It lives in New York only 17,000 young, male and Latinos, for which don't ask the question, "Who am I listening?"
But, "How often am I going to interrupt? When I'm stopped?"
And in my research, I found that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number up to 78 percent when they got 17.
The last question I want to ask you is, what is it that it's a model?
And I think you'll expect this answer: "If you're a little bit thin and shiny hair, then you feel very happy and fabulous."
And then we'll give you an answer that might maybe convey this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, inspirational, passionate people."
Everything is true, but it's only half the story, because what we never tell the camera before, what I never said before, is, "I feel unsure."
And I feel unsafe because I have to think about my appearance every single day.
And if you ever ask yourself, "Am I happier if I had little legs and shiny hair?"
And then you should meet a couple of modules, because they have the tiniest legs and the most beautiful hair and the coolest rubber stuff, and they're because of the most uncertain women on the planet.
And when I was preparing this talk, it seemed really hard to get a more honest balance, because I felt very uncomfortable with it, and I said, "I got all the benefits of a pile that got mixed up to my favor." And it doesn't feel very good to add, "And I'm not always happy."
It was very difficult to close a legacy of oppression and race when I'm one of the biggest uses of it.
But I'm also happy and I'm honored to stand here, and I find it's amazing that before I've reached this here, 10 or 20 years, and I've been a more anxious, because I'd probably not say what I got to do, or I'd not say, I'd say, maybe I'd say, "Well, I've paid this," which I paid in college, which is so important.
If you take something from this talk, I hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our misbeherstanding and misconceptions.
Thank you.
I never forgot the words of my grandmother who came to life in exile, "Son, drunk Gaddafi resistance. Give him a bow.
But I'm never going to be a Gaddafi revolution.
It's been around almost two years since the Libyan revolution has been broken, inspired by the waves of mass-reaching in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolution.
I teamed up with many other Libyers, within and outside the Libyens to challenge a day of anger and to start a revolution against the tyrant regime of Gothacacis.
And she was there, a big revolution.
Boy, Lebanby women and men stood in the first row, demanded the end of the regime, gave Slogans of freedom, dignity and social justice to the air.
They proved excellent courage by being asked against the brutal dictator Gaddafis.
They've shown a very deep sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west, all the way to the South.
Finally, after six months of brutal war, and almost 50,000 deaths, we were able to free our country and to avoid the tyranny.
Gaddafi has left a big servant, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and the foundation for the end of the line.
Over four decades, Gaddafis has destroyed tyrant regimes both infrastructure and also the culture and the moral structure of the lybian society.
The devastation and the challenges, I rented how many other women are rebuilding the civil society of Lybias. We asked a participatory and fair transition to democracy and national.
Oiving to 200 organizations have been founded, and instantly after Gaddafis founded in Benghazi, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in exile, I came back to Lybias, and with unique enthusiasm, I started workinghops to organize the issues of capacity, human development and leadership.
And I started a wonderful group of women who were a great group of women, and I founded the peace platform of Libyters, a movement of women, leaders of different kinds of life, and whose goal is to engage in public, public for the societic, and to be at the same level of the rights of the democracy and the peacebuilding.
I met a very difficult environment, a very difficult environment, which has been more polarized, a community that was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and execution.
I led a Department of peacebuilding platform to get women with a participatory choice, a law that any citizen, whatever context they should have, to vote for the right and to do whatever political parties are to establish a link between the female and female, on the horizontal level, and to make a complete decision to make it happen.
At the end, our initiative was taken and successful.
Women won 17,5 percent of the nation's Criminal Court in the first elections since 52 years.
But, quite frankly, the euphoria of elections and the entire revolution went to the whole revolution, because every day we were making new messages of violence.
We were taking a morning to the Council about the stories of ancient mosques and Sufi masters.
And on another morning, we got news about the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the message.
And then another morning, the murder of the armed forces were signed up by the armed forces.
And really every day, we were condemning the tyrant of military and their ongoing challenges against the human rights prisoners and their disregusion of laws and laws.
Our society, designed by a revolutionary spirit of mind, polarized and separated from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice that they had initially held.
Intolerance, persever, and riff, became the icon of the Fol newspaper of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our discourse and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to suggest that as a nation that made false choices and wrong choices.
We've put our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security to the rescue.
Did the appropriate and the change between female and male candidates have brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, she's not.
What is it then?
Why is it that our society will continue to polarize and dominate and dominate the political of dominance and the opposition between men and women?
Perhaps the women were not the only thing that missed, but the female values of compassion, the Gnade and the agreement.
Our society needs a national dialogue and consensus as it needed the elections, which has only empowered polarization and disinpletion.
Our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it needs to have the numerical, quantitative embodiment of the female.
We have to stop doing the killing name and demand a day of revenge.
We need to start out in the name of compassion and the Gnade.
We need to develop a female discourse that is not only validing the values, but also compelled to be able to do something like cash, cooperation instead of competition,
These are the ideals that desperately need one of the deceived lybacia to achieve peace.
Because peace has a nightmare, and in this alchemy, it's about the interstellation of feminine and masking view.
That's the real thing.
And we need to do that in existential ways before we do it sociopolitical.
After a verse from the Koran, "Salam" -- peace" -- "is the word of the Good God, rall."
The word "raheem" again, which is known in all the late-raagical traditions, has the same Arabic root as the word "raject" and symbolized the maternal feminine who surs all of humanity, the man and the female and the female, all the tribes have gone.
And just like the mother's assurance that grows in him, completely hangs the basic body of compassion to the whole existence.
And so we were told, "My Gnade is going to get all these things."
And so we were told, "My Gnade has pre-deemed for my grall."
Let's all of us enjoy the art of the giar.
Thank you.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best country in the world, and I grew up with the song "Nothing."
And I was very proud.
In school, we've been tracking the story of Kim Glung, but we've learned not much about the world, except America, South Korea and Japan, our enemies.
Although often I wondered how the outside world was, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until a whole changing time.
When I was seven years old, I saw a public execution, but I thought my life was normal in North Korea.
My family was not poor, and I've never had to suffer from hunger myself.
But in 1995, my mother brought a letter with me, and my sister of a colleague of mine.
And it said, "If you're going to wake this thing, our five family members will not be in the world because we've been eating nothing for two weeks.
We're on the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we're going to die soon."
I was so shocked.
I first heard about this that people were suffering in my country.
I went down to the station, and I saw something horrible I can't delete from my memory.
There was a bleed woman on the ground, and a child who was carved in her arm looked helplessly in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because everyone was busy doing so well to care for themselves and their families.
There was a big famine in North Korea in the mid-1990s.
At the end, more than a million-a-half-year-old Saudiians were sick to the victims, and many more of them survived because they ate grasses and trees and trees.
And the current waste has been more and more common, so at night, everything was going to bother me, except the lights of China on the other side of the tag we lived in.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of Amroc, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very, very dilatable, and it enables Northstans to escape.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw the bodies floating in the river.
I can't tell you a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can tell you that while the devastating years of famine, I was sent to China.
I just thought I was going to be separated for a short time from my family.
I never thought it took me to have 14 years to come back and work.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I didn't have any idea of what life would be like a Northstore refugee, but I realized that it's not just incredibly difficult, but it's also very dangerous. Because North Koreans are being seen by illegal immigrants in China.
So I lived in constant anxiety that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny of North Korea.
One day, my biggest nightmare was true when I was caught by the Chinese police and was sent to the police department.
Somebody accused me to be a Northstorean, so they tested my Chinese knowledge and asked me countless questions.
I was so afraid, I thought I would explode my heart.
If anything is unnatural, I could be imprisoned and signed.
I thought that that would be the end of my life, but I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
After they finished the poll, a lawyer said to the other, "That was a ridiculous breakthrough.
She's not a Northstorean."
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are taking messages to foreign messages called Asyl, but many are caught and signed by the Chinese police.
These girls were very lucky.
Even though they got caught, they eventually released from a tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans had not had so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China, and they are now released to North Korea, where they were tortured, imprisoned, or executed publicly.
Although I was lucky at the end of my flight, many other Northstans are not going to be like this.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard to survive.
After she learned a new language and found work, the world can be put on her head in a moment.
After 10 years of hiding, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was down in South Korea, a bigger challenge than I thought I would have been.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've also seen the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very divergent because of 67 years of the division.
I was through an identity crisis.
Am I South- or Northstorean?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no land that could have been my home.
Although the adaptation of the South Korean life did not slow down, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording press at the university.
Just when I was being treated by my new life, I got a pretty shocking call.
The North Kacadan authorities started to take the money that I sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was forced to reshape, to a remote place in the country.
They had to fly as quickly as possible, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to take back an incredible route to the freedom they've made.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea. Ironry, I took a flight back to China, and I went to the North Korean border.
Because my family did not speak Chinese, I had to run them, to more than 2,000 miles through China and then to Southeast Asia.
The bus ride lasted a week, and we got almost more caught.
Once the bus was held, a Chinese police officer came in.
He took the out of all the stuff, and he started asking questions.
Because my family did not understand Chinese, I thought they would be arrested.
When the Chinese official promised my family, I agreed, and he said that they were deaf, and I was the foreman.
He looked at me suspicious, but luckily, he believed me.
We managed to make it up to the laze border, but I had to almost pick up all my money to make the border reservations of Laos.
But even after we've crossed the border, my family was incarcerated because of illegal border resolution.
After I paid money and bribe, my family was released in a month, but shortly after that, my family was imprisoned, in the capital of Laos.
This was one of the biggest distractions of my life.
I'd done everything I could to avoid my family to liberty, and we've been so close to it, but my family's been arrested, just before the Southern Geographic message.
I went and forth between the immigration agency and the police department, and I was trying to desperately clean my family, but I didn't have enough money to pay for money to pay for money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And that was when a man's voice asked me, "What's going on?"
I was totally surprised that a stranger is caring about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and no to cheat, and paid the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get them out of jail.
I thank him about the very heart, and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he answered.
"I help the North Bronx people."
And I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The previous stranger, I was symbolized to a new hope that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the North Koreans need.
Finally, after our long journey, my family and I were back in South Korea, but the freedom to get is just one step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and as soon they get into a new country, they start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us in education, learn English, the profession and a lot more.
We can also be the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still remain in contact with family services, and we send them information and money that helps to change North Korea from inside.
I was so lucky to get so much help and inspiration in my life that I want to make hope to succeed Northstans, with international support.
I'm sure you'll see much more successful North Koreans around the world, even on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give you a request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
I want to introduce you to my brothers.
Remi is 22, and very good sight.
He can't talk, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn't be.
Remi knows what love is.
He discouraged them, and he discouraged them.
He's not greedy. He's not paying attention to the color of the skin.
He doesn't care about religious differences, and just imagine, he never told a lie.
When he sing songs from our childhood, he's trying to make words that I don't even remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown must be.
Samuel's 16. He's big. He's very good-looking.
He's got absolutely incredible memory.
He also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he had stolen my chocolate fairy, but he remembers the publication year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first episode of the teapbaties on my arm had been rolling on my arm and a lady named Gagas birthday.
Don't listen to them, don't they stop?
But many people are not right.
And in fact, because their minds are not mediated in the social version of normal, they're often over and wrong.
But what encouraged my heart and strengthened my soul was that although that was the case, even though they were not used to be normal, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "drism," it's a complex functionality of the brain that affect social communications that are involved in learning and sometimes physical skill.
It's different in each individual, and that's why Remi is so different than Sam.
And the world is, every 20 minutes, is found in a new person of autism, and although it's one of the fastest growing organisms in the world, there's no known cause or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I've met autism, but I can't remember it without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was screaming a lot.
He didn't want to play the way that the other babies did, and in fact he didn't seem to be very interested in me at all.
Remi lived and ran into his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like putting cars in a room, to fit the washing machine and eat everything that was coming out of it.
And as he got older, he became different, and the differences became more visible.
But behind the anger and the fresiness and the never-discovered hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without any biases, a human who never lied.
It's extraordinary.
Now, I can't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family, moments that I wished that they were just like me.
But I'm going to go back to the things that they've taught me about individuality, communications and love, and I really understand that these are the things I wouldn't want to trade against normality.
Ordinaryity is the beauty that makes us differences, and the fact that we are different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means there's another kind of right.
And if I could just say one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Each of us has a gift in it. And all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifices.
The chance of scale, progress and change dies in the moment that we're trying to be like someone else.
Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edgerton has filled us with awe and curiosity, with this photograph that we've done on a project of photon-filling an apple and with a degeneration expansion of only a millionth.
But now, 50 years later, we're a million times faster, and we don't see the world with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography, the Femto photographer, a new imaging technology that's so fast that it can make time-lapse images of light in motion.
And so we can build cameras that are looking for us outside of our perspective, or we can't see a <unk>-ray in our body and really ask them what we're doing with my camera.
Now, if I take a laser pointer and I cut it in a billionth of a second -- these are several fints -- I create a package of photons that are barely a millimeter wide, and this photon package of this project, this project will move in the speed of light, and, as I said, a million times faster than a product.
So if you take this project, this photon pack, and you shoot it into that bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What does light look like in timeillated?
So this whole event --
So, think, the whole event is actually taking less than a nanotone -- so long as you need the light to go back this lane -- but I'm going to slow this video up to the 10 billion so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola hasn't financed this research.
So, what happens in this movie is a lot, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
The pulse, our projectil, goes into the bottle with a photon pack, which starts to move through, and eventually breaks inside.
Part of the light is flowing out to the table, and you see the spread of the waves.
Many of the photons eventually end up with the detergent of the bottle and explode in different directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of a bubble that's floating around in the bottle.
Meanwhile, the waves are spread out on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle are focused on some images.
Now, if you take a standard project and let it go back the same route and slow that video back to 10 billion, you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie?
A day, a week? No, a year.
This would be a very boring film -- from a slow, regular projectal project.
And what about a little still-lapse photograph?
You can see again, these waves go back to the table, which drains Tomate and the wall in the back.
It's when you put a stone in a pond.
It seemed to me as if nature painted a picture, each of the satellites image, but of course our eye is a single-strained image.
But if you look at these Toms, you'll see that if the light is slipping over the Tomva, it's going to keep the light. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tomva is coming, and the light jumps around you, and after a few billion seconds, comes out.
So, in the future, if this tapto camera is built in your Camerahandy, it could be possible that you could go to a supermarket and find out if you're a fruit tank, if you don't touch it at all.
So how did my team build this camera at MIT?
So, as a photographer, you know, if you take a picture of a short-lime, you have very little light, but we're making a billion times faster than your short-lurpime, so you're not getting as good as light at all.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photon package, a million times, and we're drawing it again with very clever synchrony, and we're combining these gigabytes of data to make these Femto videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data and do very interesting things.
So, Superman can fly.
Other heroes can be invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future super- superheroes: Can they see corners?
The idea is that we're going to clust a little light on the door.
It's going to be thrown off, go into the room, it's reflected back to the door, and eventually back to the camera, and we can use these more extracting layers of the light.
And that's not science fiction. We've even built it.
On the left, you see our Femto camera.
Behind the wall, it's a soup hidden, and we're going to let the light go down the door.
After our paper was published in the Nature Communications, it was taken from Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to be rid of this light project, and they're going to push it down to this wall, and this photon package is going to be dragged back into all directions, and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden soup, and then the wall will reflect a part of the light and a tiny fraction of the light, and then it's going to come back to the camera in a very interesting way, but it's going to be very
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique skills.
It has a very good time-consumption, and it can look at the world in light.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what the point is.
So by taking a laser light, we can take a raw image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really make sense, but then when we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and we try to analyze the different light-subing, we can see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So this is our reconstruction.
We have a little bit to do with it before we can do it in the lab, we could build cars that are preventing collisions and recognize what's behind the curve, or we can search for dangerous fires by looking at light, be reflected through the open windows, or we can build endcos, and we can see the bodies in the papotcapcopes and also see them around the papototopes.
But because of the blood flow and tissue, of course, it's very challenging, and that's really a test call for scientists to think about, now, about Femto photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical imaging problems.
So, as at Doc Edgerton, even a scientist, the science has become an art, an art of ultra-through photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data we're collecting every time, not only the scientific structure. We can also create a new form of computer photography with paint photography, and color capture, and we can't even see that wave between these waves and those things.
But it's also something fun, too.
If you look at those waves under the bottleneck, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
And it turns out that we've almost got light-speed, weird effects, and Einstein would have liked to see this picture incredibly.
And the sequence that happens in the world appears in the camera in a more gradually order, so by applying the relationship of space and time, we can correct those biases.
So no matter whether photography is around us, or the creation of a new imaging tool for medicine or new forms of art, since we've been able to open all the data and details on our website and hope that the Cheetators, the creative community, and the research community, we should stop showing us that we should start on the megapels, the next-dimensional imagery, the next-dimensional graph,
It's about time. Thank you.
There are many ways that we can improve our lives with people.
We don't meet every neighbor in the street so that many of the deliberations don't get passed through, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the last few years, using things like stickers and chores and chalk.
The projects that came from my questions, how much rented my neighbors?
How can we borrow more things without worrying each other?
How can we share our memories on the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being distracted by the huge eaves that have been inseding to hundreds of years of loving, drunk and woolly and even inertcy. I'm very familiar with a city where there's always music.
I think every time someone never fails, there's a parade in New Orleans.
In this town, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world are, but it's also the city with most missing worms in America.
I live near this house, and I thought, how can I make it, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever?
I lost someone I loved in 2009.
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. Her death suddenly came and unexpected.
I've been thinking a lot about death, and I felt a lot of gratitude for my life, and it's gotten me to clear what I'm now important about in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose your life-to-day life and forget what's really important.
With the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a page of abandoned house into a huge blackboard and I wrote a treasure plate, "If I die, I want to die ..." I can take a piece of chalk, think about his life and share their hopes in this public space.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it's growing.
I want to share some sentences with you that were written by people on the wall.
"Wait to die, I want to be charged with piracy."
"Wait me to die, I want to stand on a full-time conclusion about the International Pass."
"Wait to die, I want to sing for millions of people."
"Wait to die, I want to plant a tree."
"Wait to die, I want to live under the web."
"Wait to die, I want to keep them in my arms once."
"Wait to die, I want to be somebody who is cavallery."
"Everything I die is I want to be myself."
This neglected place became a sensual place, and the hopes and dreams of people brought me to the laugh, the wine and the harshness of the times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors in a new and consistent way.
It's about creating space for the meeting and thinking and remembering what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I've done this last year, and I've gotten hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community, so my colleagues and I've built a buildingbox in the world like Kazanhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and other walls.
We've shown how much power we have in our public spaces if we have the opportunity to get up and share more of our voices.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world of ever-reasing distractions, it's more important than ever ever before to look at things with the right view and think that life is short and sensitive.
We're often sentenced to talking about death, or even thinking about it, but I've realized that the preparation of death is one of the things that strengthen the most.
And the idea of death is that we're really excited about life.
Our common spaces show us what's important to us as individuals and to be a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and fears and stories, people around us can not just help us create better places, they can help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved in my own favorite math. I'm a very special problem for anyone who's engaged in the smart mathematics, is that we're like a business worker.
Nobody really knows what we're doing.
And so I'm going to try to explain to you what I do today.
And dancing is one of the most human activities.
We're excited about the trauma of a bullet and a cheeker, as you'll see.
So, to the ballet, there's an extraordinary amount of knowledge and abilities, and possibly a fundamental manifestation that might have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders like Parkinson's are slowly destroying these extraordinary ability. That's what they do to my people who were talking to Jan Stripling who was a ballet.
Over the years, you've done a lot of progress in the treatment.
But nevertheless, there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease, and they have to live with the unsafe symptoms like weaknesses, tremor, abobidity and others that are causing this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to measure the progress of objective, and ultimately the only way to know whether there's a cure, if we have an objective metric that can answer that question.
And the trouble is that, for Parkinson's disease and other control disorders, there's no biomarkers, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing that's available to this 20-minute test in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means outside clinical trials, it's never going to do it.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
That would save a trained tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a very expensive hospital staff.
By the way, it costs 300 percent to go into the neurological field.
So I want to propose to you an unconventional method that we're trying to do that, because we're all at least, virtual uselesss like my-dominated Beriple.
Here's a video of the vibrating mood sound.
And that's what happens in the healthy condition when someone is creating speech sounds. We can look at the moody ballbicks, because we have to coordinate all these vocal organs when we create sound, and we all have the genes for that. FoxP2.
And like Ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to be until they're learning.
And by the way, we can determine the position of vibrating mood, and like the limb's limb is also affected by the vocal organs of Parkinson's disease.
In the lower term, you can see an example of irregular vocal sounds of evidence.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
True, weakness, eal, sweetness.
The language is even more likely to be more and more franty, and that's an example of it.
And this impacts on the voice can be minimal, sometimes, but with digital microphones and accurate effects software, combined with new machine learning that's now quite advanced, we can now see where someone is in a mammoth between disease and health, just because of the sounds of the sounds.
How can we measure these tests with clinical trials? Well, they're both non-invasive. The test for neurologists.
It's as little as it is. The infrastructure is already there.
You don't need to build new clinics for that.
And both of them are accurate. They're not being conducted by experts.
So you can be done by yourself.
They're very fast, it's 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something's extremely cheap, you can use it in a very large order.
And we can get to this amazing goals.
We can reduce logistical difficulties for patients.
Patients don't have to do routine control in the hospital.
We can get objective data through conventional observation.
We can do inexpensive mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we'll first be able to do a research for the whole population.
We now have the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
And today, we're going to take the first step in this direction, and we're going to start the Parkinson's scenario.
A-to-Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we want to take a very large number of voices around the world to have enough initial data for the release of these goals.
We have calls that are accessible to three-quarters of a billion people on this planet.
Anyone with no Parkinson's disease can call cheaply to leave images for a few cents. I'm known to be blessed with the fact that we've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.
If you take samples, say, 10,000 people, you can tell who's healthy and who you are not?
What are you going to do with all of these samples?
What happens is that the patient in the phone has to say if this person is suffering Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some of them may not be made until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting, and that's what's important, because we're in order to figure out what are the actual markers for Parkinson's.
At the moment, your 86 percent accuracy is there?
It's much better.
My students Thettis -- I have to make it so fantastic because he's done this amazing work -- has shown that it's also working on the cellular network, which allows this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call that a improvement.
That means people can call -- people can call the phone with the phone and they can make the test. People could call Parkinson's disease, take their voice, so that their doctor could check the progress of the disease.
Right.
Thank you very much. Max Little, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
Here I live. I live in Kenya in the southern edge of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows of my father's eye, and that's behind the kitchen, the Nairobi National Park.
The Nairobi National Park is just a small-scale construction. That means that wildlife like zebras can leave the park at any time.
The predators, the lions, they follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that was killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and I found it dead. It was terrible. It was the only ever everb.
My tribe, the colony of the Massai, believes that we would come together with our animals and the Norwegian landscape of the sky, and that's why our animals mean so much.
Even as a child, I learned how to hate lions.
Our warrior's name, her name. They protect our tribe and our grandchildren. They're also on this problem.
and kill lions.
Here's one of six lions killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why there's only so few lions in Nairobi.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years of suffering to the cows of his father. That's how I was.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions are scared of fire.
But then I realized that this wouldn't really help us, but the lions are helping to see the cows better.
But I didn't give up. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to find a bird's disease.
I wanted the lions to think I was standing next to the cow's.
But lions are very smart animals.
They come, they see the bird search, and they go again. But the next time they come and they say, this thing doesn't move, that's still there.
And they reach, and they kill our livestock.
One night, I was holding the stall. I was walking around with a torch around him, and that time, the lions didn't catch up.
lions fear light, and that moves.
I had an idea.
Even as a little boy, I was working all day in my room, and once again, I took the new radio apart my mother, and the day she took me almost anything, but I had learned a lot about electronics.
I took an old car battery and a policy-and-drug from a motorcycle, and it shows if you want to turn to the right or the left. It's noisy.
And I turned to a switch to turn the lights off and turn it off.
This is a little pearl from a broken flaphlight lamp.
And then I built everything together.
The solar panel is what the battery is doing, the battery is providing electricity to the correct plant. I call it a transformator.
And the right-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-down.
You can see that the pearls are pointing out, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is what it looks like for the lions when they come.
The lights are bright, and the lions think I'm going to go around the ruball, and I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
So I've been installed this at home, and since then we've had no problem with lions.
And then our neighbors heard about it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She lost a lot of her animals to lions, and she asked me if I could install her lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I installed the lights. You can see the lions in the background.
I've since since since spent seven houses in the neighborhood with lights, and they're working really well.
My idea is now used in all Kenya, including predators like hyena or leopards, and the lights also serve to keep the elephants out of the farms.
My invention helped me go to a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and is helping fundraising and education.
I even brought my friends home, and together we install the lights where there's no one there, and I'm showing people how to use it.
A year ago, I only took a boy from the savanna who was cudding his cows. I saw airplanes about me and I said, "I'm going to sit in a room!"
And I'm here now.
I was allowed to start with a plane, for my first TEDTalk.
If I'm big, I want to be a plane engineer and a pilot. That's my big dream.
I used to borrow lions, but through my invention, I can save the cows of my father and we can do it together, side by side with lions, without any argument.
Ash<unk> Oln. In my language, that means, I thank you.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you have this scholarship. Yes.
You work on other electrical innovations.
What's the next thing on the list?
My next invention, well, I'm working on an electric fence. A electrode fence?
Yeah, I know, electrical fences have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've tried it, you've never done it, right -- yeah, I've tried it, but I've given the trial back because I got a blow.
First, it's hard. Richard Turer, you're a little special.
We're going to hire you all the way to step up, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand, and I'm passionate about photography, but today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite images, and I've never done one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleists, no chance to shoot one more time. Not even the lighting was taken.
To be honest, most of them were shot by random tourists.
My story started when I was a talk at New York, and my wife made this picture where I would hold my daughter on my first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57th and 5th.
And just a year later, we were back in New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see where this is going from.
When the third birthday of my daughter came to say, "Hey, why don't you bring Sabina to New York and do this a father-in-law post to continue the ritual?"
So we started asking, by the time, about to ask for a lot of tourist tourists to make a picture of us.
You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is when you're going to get a completely stranger and you're going to get your camera.
Nobody ever said no, and fortunately, nobody's ever been touched with our camera.
And we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This one was taken just after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened the day so that a five-year-old can understand it.
These pictures are much more than just a recorded moment, or a certain journey.
They're also a chance for us to keep the time in October a week and how we change ourselves from year to year, not only physical, but in everything.
Because, although we always do the same picture, our view changes as time, and as it's always reached new milestones, I can see the life with their eyes, how it deals with everything that it sees.
This very intense time we spend with each other is something that we value and expect for every year.
Last, while one of our trips, we went for a walk, and suddenly she remained as if they were repaired, she's looking at a red mark on a diagram of a dollkin that they had learned as a little kid, at the previous travel.
And she told me about her feelings that she thought was five-year-old about that particular job.
She said that she remembered her heart being blown out of the chest when she saw the store for the first nine years ago.
And now she looks in New York for high schools, because she's really trying to study in New York.
And I realized that it was obvious: The most important thing we all create is memory.
And so I want to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious memory of memories.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not really at all a family photograph.
I'm always the one that makes this picture.
I want to encourage each of you today to come to the image and not ask someone to ask, "Would you make a picture of us?"
Thank you.
BLEU = 25.65, 56.3/32.8/20.6/13.3 (BP=0.962, ration=0.962)
