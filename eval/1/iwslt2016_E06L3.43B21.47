When I was 11 years old, I was hit a morning of the sounds of the sounds of a little joy.
My father heard his little, gray radio show on the BBC.
He looked very happy at what was pretty unusual at the time, because he was mostly talking about the news.
He called "The Taliban are gone."
I didn't know what that meant, but it made me very happy, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school," he said.
I'm never going to forget this morning.
I mean, a real school.
The Taliban turned the power in Afghanistan when I was six, and they banned girls to go to school.
And so I was covering five years of a boy and I was convicted of my older sister who couldn't have been able to participate in a secret school.
Only we could go to school.
We took another way to see where we went.
We're hidden of our books in a car store so it looks like we'd just go.
We've been in a house, over 100 girls in a small room.
It was kind of a cold in the winter, but it was incredibly hot in the summer.
We all knew that we were risking our lives: teachers, students and our parents.
And then again, the class had to be, suddenly, for a week, because the Taliban had been baked.
We've never known how much they knew about us.
Are they going to be?
Did you know where we live?
We were afraid of fear, but we wanted to go to school.
I had a lot of lucky fortune in a family where education was more important than and identified daughters.
My grandfather was far ahead of his time.
A foreign stranger from a remote province of Afghanistan, and he was able to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school, and it was rejected by his father.
My mother was trained as a teacher.
That's it.
Two years ago, she went to the workforce, just to turn our house into a school for girls and women from the neighborhood.
And my father -- here, here -- the first thing in his family, who ever received a school.
And it was always clear that his kids would get a education, but also his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite all the risks.
It looked like a much larger risk to send their kids to school.
I know that I've been in the late 1990s sometimes frustrated by our lives, from the endless fear and the perspective of mindless.
I had good fun to give up, but my father said, "Told, listen to me. You can lose everything in your life.
You can be stolen. You can get transported from your house.
But one thing that's always going to be, that's what's in there, and even if we're paying our blood to your lunch, we'll do that.
So -- you're still going to give me?"
I'm 22 years old today.
I grew up in a country that was destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have a higher degree of college, and if my family didn't have been used so much for my education, I would have been a one of these women.
Instead, I'm here today, as a proudist of the Middle College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was rejected by his family, because he was forced to send his daughters to school, one of the first people who criticized me.
It's not just with my college degree, but that's why I was the first woman and I'm the car to run through Kabul.
My family believes me.
I have big dreams, but my family has more dreams for me.
So I'm a global ambassador for 1010, a global campaign for education for women.
So I've been able to start to start to start to start the APLA, and maybe the first business manager for girls in Afghanistan, a country where the school teacher is still risky for girls.
It's wonderful to see how students in my school are asking a great master of all of them to hear opportunities.
And as they're a parent and fathers, as I was, as I was still, my parents, despite the opposite and the opposite of all the other.
As Ahmed Ahmed. That's not my real name, and I can't show his face, but Ahmed Ahmed is a father of my students.
A month ago, his daughter and he was on the home home of San Francisco, and they're death from a bomb to a mountain to a few minutes.
When he came home, the phone rings and he threw a voice gun if he sent his daughter to school, she would try to try it again.
He said, "Tow me now, if you want to, but I'm not going to put the future of my daughter in the game because of your old and disrupted ideas."
In Afghanistan, I've discovered something that's often been rejected by the West, and the majority of us have success, a father, who recognizes the value of his daughter, and that's because of the fact that their success is also success.
It's not to be that our mothers are not going to play a critical role in our success.
In fact, they're often the ones that are focused and compelling for a promising future of their daughters, but in a society like Afghanistan, the support of men is unaware of the support of the men.
The Taliban just went to school for a few hundred thousand girls because it was illegal.
But today, in Afghanistan, three million girls are going to press the school bank.
Afghanistan appears to be seen by America, so different.
The Americans see how insecure changes are.
I'm afraid that the changes aren't long and then changing the U.S. military groups.
But when I'm in Afghanistan, when I see students in my school, and their parents, who are helping them to encourage them, I see a very promising future and a long-term change.
Afghanistan is a country for me to hope and the unconventable possibility, and remember the girls every day, the TEDxLA.
And as I have big dreams.
Thank you.
And I do all that, including living -- my life was characterized by seven years of work in Africa as a young man.
In 1971, 1977, I see it young, but I'm not -- -- I have been in Zambia, Kenya, the ivory Coast, Algeria and Somalia, projects with the technical collaboration with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we put on the legs, failed.
I was desperate.
I was, 21 years ago, thinking that we are Muslim and good work in Africa.
Instead, we killed everything we started doing.
Our first project, which was my first book called "Rets of Zamis", one of the things that we wanted to show in Italy is the people in the Sambansans, like food.
We came to Italian drones in South America, in this sharp valley, which leads to Sami's beach. We trained the local population of the local coral reefs in Italian and pobini.
Of course, the local community had absolutely no interest in it, so we paid them to work, and sometimes they'll find them.
And we were amazed that there was no such a rural agricultural agriculture.
But instead of asking why they didn't build anything, we just said, "God thank you that we're here."
Or can people go to the Sambique to the head."
Of course, everything wonderful in Africa.
We had this mad tomato. In Italy, they became so large, in Zambia.
We couldn't believe it, and we said, "Look, like agriculture is just."
When the tomato reefs were closed and red, about 200 obs of the river and they were all about 200 times.
And we said to the Toramb, "Oh God, the pouper!"
And they said, "Yes, so we don't have agriculture here."
"Why did you say this not?" "You never asked us."
I just thought of Italy, we were so great as a question in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the French ones did, and then I saw what they did, I became quite proud of our project in Sambia.
We've been doing the nolquies at least.
You should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we've never been calling out of the non-human African people.
You should read the book "The Vaginaad Aid Aad Aad Moyo, she's a post-the-profit economist.
The book was published in 2009, 2009.
We've given the African continent of a 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you what this money has been done.
Just read her book.
You can read from a African woman, which we've been doing.
We are Western people, colonists, actors, missionists, and there are only two species that we deal with people. We criticize them or we are patriocological.
Both words come from the Latin root, which means "Vather" means.
They have two different meanings.
Conconological: I treat every other culture than they were my children. "I love you so much."
Patronis: I treat every other culture than they were my granddad.
And so white people in Africa are called "bitiy," boss.
I was shocked when I read the book "mall" "mall" by a laugher. He said, especially in economics, if people don't want help, let's go back to the back.
It should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of help is respect.
Now, the gentleman who opened this conference, a pole on the ground and said, "Can you imagine a city that's not geolololic?"
When I was 27 years old, I decided to respond to people, and I invented a system called a company called a company called a company that never gets motivated, but you're going to be motivated to be able to be a service of local talent, the local talent, the local man who's dream to have better.
What you do -- you hold the mouth.
You're never going to have a community with ideas, you're going to put together with a local community.
We don't work from offices.
We meet in cafes. We meet in Kneipes.
We don't have infrastructure.
We're going to close friends and find out what the person wants.
The most important part is the passion.
You can convey somebody to a idea.
If this person doesn't like what to do?
The passion for your own growth of the person is the most important.
The passion for your own is the most important of humanity.
We're helping them to find knowledge because nobody can be successful.
The person with this idea may not have the knowledge, but it's available.
I had a case for many years ago, why instead of getting into a community and tell people what to do, why don't we hear them? But not in community collections.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community collections.
You never have entrepreneurs, and they never say what they want to do with their money, what opportunities they see.
Designing has this blink.
The most common people in the community don't know because they never seem to be in public meetings.
We work to do one thing to do it, a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
A new job needs to be created.
This is the house of the company, the hospital of the factory that you sit with you in your house, in your kitchen and the cafeteria, helps you to find the tools to change your passion in a way.
I tried this in a sectionist, West Africa, trying to do it.
I was also doing a lot of time, trying to get out of the dampier, where we say other things to do what to do.
And so I went through the streets in the first year, and I had three days of my first clients. He helped him in a garage, he was Mai. I helped him to get to a restaurant in a restaurant and to sell it, and then the fishermen came to the fishermen and said, "You know, you've helped us help us."
I helped these five fish, working together, and I had this wonderful tuna not to sell a factory in Albany to 60 cents, but to Japan for 15 dollars, and then the farmers came to me and said, "Hey, you helped them."
I had been walking in a year, 27 projects. The government came to ask me, "How do you do this?
How do you do?" I said, "I do something very, very difficult.
I hear the mouth and I hear them."
So -- so -- the government says, "Do you try it again."
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.
We've been able to help 40,000 companies in the organization.
There's a new generation of companies that are going to be on loneliness.
Peter Brown, one of the best business workers of history died with 96 years ago.
Peter Brown was philosophy professor before he was involved with companies. Peter Brown said, "Make is actually unrosible with a entrepreneurial society and economics."
Design is the death of the entrepreneurship spirit.
So you build Christiech, without knowing what the smartest human Christiech wants to do with their money and their energy.
You have to learn how to get that to one.
You have to offer them discourse and privacy. You have to be great to help them, and they will get more aroused.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 150,000 people, intelligence and passion?
Now, what you've been talking about today, you've been asking me to do this morning?
Beautious, passionate people. They've been harassing you.
I want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- the unperable fossil fuels, manufacturing, manufacturing, and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable.
Machine engine is not sustainable.
The open-up species of participation is not sustainable.
We have to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways, cure, build, transport them and then we can bring them into a conspiracy.
The technologies are not there.
Who will be able to invent this technology for the green revolution? universities? Let's forget!
The government? forget!
They're going to be entrepreneurs. And they're doing it now.
I read a wonderful story in a futoristic magazine for many years ago.
There was a group of experts who invited to talk about the future of New York City in 1860s.
In 180, they came together and they looked at what would happen in 100 years with the city of New York. The conclusion was a historical: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.
Why? They looked at the curve and said, when the population grows in that speed, they needed six million horses to get people and it would be impossible to get the crap with six million horses.
Because they'd go under the crap.
and they're seeing the dirty technology that lives from New York City.
What happens? 40 years later, in 1900, there were 100 car companies in the United States -- 1001.
The idea of finding a different technology had done the race. There were little factories in the back of the back of the country.
Andnold, Michigan. Henry Ford.
There's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, they have to be offered by discourse.
They don't come and talk to you.
And next, you have to offer them absolutely, committed and passionate services.
Then you have to tell them the absolute truth about entrepreneurship.
From the smallest to the largest company, all of you have to do is to do three things: to sell the product, which needs to be great, and the financial script has to be huge.
Do you guess what?
We never met a single person who can produce something at the same time, sell and care about money.
It doesn't exist.
This person never was born.
We've been doing research, and we've been looking at the 100 inans of the world -- Carnegie, Wdohouse, Ford Ford Ford, the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have been, just one: no one was founded by just a person.
Now we teach 16 teenage women in North Carolina, and we start to teach them the same side of Richard Bransica, and the task is the 16 year-old woman, in the first two sides of Richard Bransian, to facilitate the word as often as he uses the word "The word "The word "The word."
Never again, 32 times "h"
It wasn't alone when he started.
No one company was born alone. No one.
So we can create a community where the facilitator who's wearing a small manager background in cafeteria and Bars, and your loved buddy who are doing what someone who's done for this gentleman who talks about this guy who says, "What do you need to tell you?
What can you do? Can you make it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you pay attention to the money?"
"Oh, no, I can't do that." "Do you think I'm going to find somebody for you?"
We activate communities.
We have groups of volunteers who support companies in it, to help them find the tools and people, and we've found that the miracles of local population will change culture and the economy of this community can only change a passion of the passion of their lives and their imagination.
Thank you.
I've learned five years ago how it should be to be Alice in the miracles of the world.
Penn State University asked me -- a professor for communication -- to address engineers in communication.
I was scared --
Fear. Fear. In those students with their big brains and their big books and their big books, I don't trust me.
But when the conversation developed, it turned me to see Alice, when she was going down to the brain of a batet and saw a door to a whole new world.
And I felt like I was talking to students. I was amazed about the idea that they had, and I wanted to understand that other man in this miracle of this village.
I think to open this door, it requires great communication.
We need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world.
Because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems, like energy, environmental health and health, and if we don't know about it, and we don't understand it, it's not going to go forward. I think it's a responsibility in our responsibility as a non-religious scientist.
But these great conversations don't come, when our scientists and engineers are not invited us to their miracles.
So scientists and engineers, please sit up.
I'm going to show you a couple of approaches, how do you do it, that we can see that science and technology that you're busy with, sexy and exciting.
The first question that you have to answer is, yes, and what?
Let's tell us why your scientific field is so relevant for us.
It's not just that it's been taught to us that they're looking at their clothes, but it's also telling us that their clothes, the antennahing structure in our bones, because it's important to understand and treat it.
And when it describes what it does, then it's preventable.
There's a barrier that is in understanding of your thoughts.
I'm sure you might use it in time and time and time, but why don't you just say space and time, which is much more accurate for us?
We're thinking about the idea of thinking about it, not the same as they're going to be throwing up their level.
As Einstein said, "Make things as easily as possible -- but not simpler."
You can probably tell something about your scientific field without having to deal with tradeoffs.
Some things are in the same way: examples, stories and analogies. So you can pull us into your booth.
And when you're looking at your work, then you'll get the dots away.
Have you ever asked, why is it called "Eall"?
What happens when somebody is going to be in? Another one is just a couple of weeks, and with those dots first you're in your audience.
This is not just boring, but it's also very boring to talk about the conversation of our brains, and that's what we're going to be doing.
This example of Gene Giit Brown is a lot more powerful. It shows that the special structure of the body is so stable, even the inspiration of the unique design of the Eiffelel.
The trick here is to use a single, just awkward sentence that's coming to the audience, if you can even lose the thread, you can take pictures and graphics that also inform our other senses and then to make a deeper understanding of what it describes.
These are just a few approaches that can help us open up this door and see the miracles of the world that scientists and technology.
And the engineers that I've been taught, I've been taught to make the "Nermaid in my hidden contact, I want to summarize everything with a equation.
So look at your science and you look at your comments and you're talking about it, you're sharing this through the context, and the audience says what's important, and you'll find the whole passion that you have for your incredible work, and that's what you've made, and that's the more adaptable interactions that are full of new ideas.
So scientists and engineers, if you solved this equation, I'm sure I'm interested in it.
Thank you.
Hi, this is my phone.
You can change a cell phone, and you can give a personal freedom.
You can film a cell phone, you can film a crime in humanity.
You can put a phone phone, you can put a message and start a post-creating in Egypt.
And you can take a phone phone, you can take a song, you can put it up on soundboard and be famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a year in 1984 and I live in Berlin.
Now, back to that time, we go back to this city.
You can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and showed them.
We're in the fall of 1989, and we've been to imagine that all these guys who were coming out and demanding change, a cell phone in the pocket.
Who in the room has a cell phone?
Just keep it up.
Keep your cell phones up, keep you up!
Hold it up. Android, a Blackberry, wow.
They're a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today, I want to talk about my phone and my phone and talk about how it changed my life.
And I'm going to talk about this.
These are 358 lines full of information.
Data.
And why are this information there?
In the summer of 2006, the E.S. Reission has been released.
This is a law-based line of the law enforcement.
The law line is that every telephone company in Europe, every Internet service in Europe has to store a range of Benevices.
Who says who? Who's going to send who an email?
Who is a text message?
And if you use a cell phone where you're.
All of this information is available for at least six months to two years of your phone company or your Internet carriers.
And everywhere in Europe, people are up and said, "We don't want to."
They said, we don't want to be a supply of these industries.
We want self-esteem in the digital age, and we don't want the phone companies and Internet service to store all of this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, who all said, "We don't want to."
And here you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of Berlin and said, "Fatess rather than fear."
And some people even said this could be on a pumque.
The Stasi was the head-in-in-in-whinisti in Eastwestland.
And I'm also wondering if this really works.
Can all this information work on us?
Every time I use my cell phone?
So I asked my phone company, the Nobel telegraph, who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and I asked them, "Hey, I'm going to put all the information that you've stored over me.
And I asked her once, and she said, "I didn't get a right answer. Only a half-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-Soo.
But then I said, I want to have this information because it's my life that's happening with the protocols.
So I decided to put a court process against them, because I wanted to have this information.
But the German Telegraph said, no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, it came to a comparison with them.
I'm going to take the tag back to what they're sending all of the information.
Because in the meantime, the federal strategy decided that the introduction of E.S. Senate was a law of the German law enforcement.
So I got this ugly brown turn with a CD.
And on the CD, this was what it was.
35-five lines on information.
And first I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge date. My hand.
But then I realized that after a while, this is my life.
It's six months of my life in this date.
So I was a little bit skeptical, what do I start with it?
Because you see where I'm, where I'm sleeping at night, what I do.
But then I said, I want to go to this information to public.
I want to do it published.
Because I want to show people what is the driveral supply.
And together with online and open data, I did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom out, you can go back and forth.
You can go every step I do to track.
And you can even see how I'm going to drive from Frankurturt to K<unk>n<unk>n<unk> and how many calls I do to walk.
So this is possible by this information.
It makes a little fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all about us.
It's just like this, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk a few times.
And then I'm going to call a couple friends and call them to each other.
And after a while, you call it and you call it and we call it, and we have this huge network of communication.
But you can see how people communicate with each time they call each other when they go to bed.
You can see it all.
You can see the central figures, which is the leader of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society does.
If you have access to this information, you can control society.
This is a building plan for countries like China and Iran.
This is the perfect design that you can monitor a society because you know who talks to who to give a email, all of that is possible if you have access to access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months, in Europe to two years.
As I said at the beginning, we've been asking that all these people in the streets of Berberins in 1989, cell phones in their pocket.
And the shagah may have known who was at the demonstration, and if the leader had been, who would never have happened, that would never happen.
The case of the Berlin Wall might not have happened.
And then, the case of the ivory curtain.
Because today, government agencies and companies want to store so many information about how they can get over us, online and rine.
They want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives, and they want to store it all the time long.
But self-interest and a life in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But you have to fight for self-interest today.
You have to fight for it every day.
So if you go home, you'll tell your friends that privacy is an value of the 21st century, and that's not old-fashioned.
When you go home, you're going to tell yourself, because companies and government positions have a chance to store certain information, they don't have to do it long.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company to information that you've stored over you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phone, remember you have to fight yourself to the self-time.
Thank you.
I live in South Central Central.
This is South Central: wild stores, rapid restaurants, candle spaces.
So the city plan is to meet, and then they thought about changing the name of South Central Central Central, so that it changed it for something else, in South Los Angeles, as if something changes something that's going wrong in the city.
This is South Los Angeles.
These same-controlled stores, rapid restaurants, skirts.
Like 26,5 million Americans, I live in the food-class Central Central Street, the home of Dr.R. and the Drantyys.
The cometic is that the Drantus is killing more people than the Drantys.
People die in South Central Los Angeles in a desert-controlled disease.
The obesity rate in my neighborhood is like five times higher than in Edly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I couldn't even stand with that.
And I wondered how you feel, if you didn't have access to healthy food every time you go out of the house, the negative effects that the food system has in your neighborhood.
I've been able to make sure that the Rollers bought and sell like planters.
I see dialogue centers going up like Starbucks.
And I realized that that's what it needs to stop.
I realized that the problem is the solution.
It's food, and food is the solution.
And then I didn't have a joke for 45 minutes of a apple that's not medicated with pesticides.
So I planted a food bomb on my house.
It's a piece of land that we call a park plant.
It's 45 feet at three feet.
That's the thing, it's the city.
But you have to care about it.
So I think, "Cool. I can do what I want to do because it's my responsibility, and I have to hold it in the position."
And I decided to keep it in the position.
So I came up and I got a group, the L.A. Green Gries, and we started to plant my food, fruit and fruit trees, so the whole program, vegetables.
We're a kind of a technical group, together from all social layers and from all the city, and all the city, it's completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden is beautiful.
But then somebody else is going to say.
The city came up to me, and he sort of got me to a free, and he said that I need to fix my lawn, which was a tax of a narrative.
And I thought, "Yeah, right?
The amazing thing about growing food from a piece of land that you're absolutely not?"
And I thought, "Cool." Her name."
Because it wouldn't be on that time.
The L.A. Times got wind from it. Steve Lopez made a story about it and talked to the city of Green Ground Zero. They signed a petition to Chair Chair.org, and we were successful with 900 rules.
We thought the victory was in the hands.
My city actually called it, and said that they support it and love what we do.
So, really, why shouldn't they do that?
LA.A. has the most room in the United States.
They have 67 miles in the palck.
These are 20 Central Park.
It's enough area to plant 725 million plant plants.
Why would it not be that?
You get 1,000 seeds in the agricultural plant.
With green beans, you get fruit and vegetables in the value of 75 dollars.
It's my grandpilding, I say people that they should grow their own food.
Their own food is like to print its own money.
You see, I have a legacy in South Central.
I grew up there. I grew up my sons there.
And I'm more confident to be part of this unconventable reality that was made by other people, and I'm going to make my own reality.
Look, I'm an artist.
Working is my graffiti. I plant my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, the walls, I'm putting lawn and park plants.
I use the garden, the Earth, like a piece of stuff, and the plants and the trees are my mainest to do this stuff.
You would be surprised what the ground can do everything if you use it as a canvas.
You can't imagine how amazing a sunflower is, and how they touch people.
So what happened?
I've seen a tool of mine as I've seen a tool for education and the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We're the ground.
You would wonder how kids are influenced by it.
There's the most therapeutic and most gentle act that you can do, especially in the middle of the city.
You get straws.
I remember this time when my mother came to her daughter, it was about 10:30 in the morning. They were in my garden, and I came out and looked at it.
I felt really bad because they were there, and I said, "You know, you don't have to do that.
It's not the way to the street."
I've been upset when I saw people who were so close to me and hungry, and that just made me feel like this. People asked me, "Fin, you don't know, you're afraid that people will steal your food."
And I said, "Aorm hell, no, I don't know what it's going on.
It's also on the street.
So this is the idea.
I want them to take it, but at the same time I want them to take care of their health."
At a time, I put a garden in this homeless house in Cairo.A.A.
These are the guys that helped me to put the car in the wheel.
It was cool, and they shared their stories about how it influenced them, and how they planted her mother and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed it, even for a moment.
Green Gries have been building about 20 gardens.
Our way to our firons were coming up to 50 people and we did it, and these are all volunteers.
When children grow farmers, eat babies.
When they grow jellyfish, they eat jellyfish.
But if they're not offered anything from it, if they're not shown how food and body lives, they eat blindly, whatever you're doing.
I see young people who want to work, but they put them in this thing -- I see color children that are exactly on the path that they're in for, and they're not going to do it.
I see the hullers, as a chance of training these kids to care about their communities to live a sustainable life.
And if we do that, who knows?
We could make the next George Washington Carver.
But if we don't change the composition of the ground, we'll never do it.
So this is one of my plans. I want to do it.
I want to plant a whole area of gardens where people can share the food in the same block.
I want to take ship trucks and turn them into healthy cafeteria.
So you don't understand me wrong.
I'm not talking about free snails, because it's not sustainable.
The weird thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it.
I'm talking about people who are working and children from the streets, and they're enjoying the joy and the honor of being built into their own food, and when you open farmers.
So what I want to do here is to make this sexy.
I want you to become all the ecological tranders, gang-hirts.
We need to turn the picture of a ganglight.
If you're not a vaterer, you're not a gang.
You're going to be a vaster, you know?
Let's take the gun to your choice.
If you want to meet me, don't call me if you're sitting in a box and you want a meeting where you talk about it, you know, you're talking about anything else.
When you want to meet me, you come with your skirts, you'll see in my garden so that we can plant some of these things.
Peace. Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about one of my favorite words in Oxford English dictionary is "nnnolddyold."
Because it sounds so beautiful.
And "nollynold" means "nessful politicians."
Although in the 19th century a newspaper leader was a better definition: "A Snolly is somebody who's a office, independent, or program, or post-preating, and success by the most dominant force of the aristocracy."
I have no idea what's called a toy name.
In other words, I think.
But it's very important that words are in the center of politics, and all politicians know that they need to try to control language.
1771, for example, the British parliament, newspapers, not the same word of the debuting.
And that was actually back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary name of Brazby, who was tracking the parliament.
And they threw it in London, and we put it in London, but he was brave enough, and he finally got so much support in London, and he finally had so much support in London.
And a few years later, we find the first confession for "meate" as a lot of valleys."
And then, in fact, the word is for the word of a pub.
But that's not true. It's coming back to a senior officer's press.
But to show you how words and politics are, I want to take you with the United States, at the time when they've just reached independence.
And you saw the question about how to call George Washington, the state of the world,
I didn't know.
What's the leader called a universal nation?
It's been based on the Congress for a long time.
And there were all sorts of possible suggestions.
I mean, some people wanted to call it Washington, and others, his high-vice of Washington, and again, the freedom of the people of the United States.
It's not that much more.
Some people just wanted to call him king.
They thought that was a lot of time.
They were not monographistic, they wanted to choose the king for a certain time.
It could have been working.
But everyone was unfinished because this debate was three weeks ago.
I've read the days of a writer who's always writing, "I've been thinking about the same issue."
The reason for the end of the time, and the long-term was that the demographic house was against the Senate.
The representative house didn't want Washington to be a stupid. They didn't want it.
The king call it, and maybe it gives it to ideas about its results.
They wanted to give him the most frightening, the most vulnerable title that they could imagine.
This title was "Pory."
You didn't invent the title. He knew it before. But he just meant that somebody was a series of a series of a meeting.
It's like a jury of a jury.
It didn't have the size of the book "write," or "withing."
Sometimes there were a female president of small colonial workers and government groups, but it was really a unconvenly title.
And so the Senate refused to get it.
They said, "That's ridiculous, you can't call him President.
This guy has to have been signed and fighted by foreign people.
Who will be serious if he has a stupid name like President of America's United States's United States?"
And then after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't have to go.
Instead, you're not going to be the word "The Recess" but they really wanted to understand that they were absolutely not because of their honest respect and civil nations, whether or civil nations, whether it's a monarchy where it's a state of the state of the World's chief, that is the most respected, and the other people in the World Bank, not to the other people,
You can learn three interesting things.
And the first thing, and that's what I think is the best thing, until now I don't find out whether the Senate has ever been reported by the author.
Obama, President Obama, he's just the title of a beloved. He's waiting for the Senate.
And then you can learn that if a government says that something temporary is -- you'll wait 223 years later.
Third, and that's really important, that's the most important point, is that the title of the United States, the United States of America today doesn't sound so scary, right?
and with something that has more than 5,000 volatride deaths that he has, and the largest economy of the world and a bomatet and a plant and all this stuff.
And reality has given the title of size.
And that's what the Senate won at the end.
They have a respectary title.
And the other concern of the Senate, the rude of self-esteem, then it was like this.
You know how many nations have a president?
147.
Because they all want to sound like the guy with 5,000 nuclear fighters and so forth.
So finally, the Senate lost the board and the representative house because nobody feels more humbling when you're told you're the president of America.
And that's the most important thing you can take away, and I'll give you a message.
And politicians try to use words to shape reality and control reality, but actually change the reality of the words more than the words that might ever change reality.
Thank you.
So I came to a Laster with about 50 railroad railroad, and I got to the fight of Walalalabad -- a 12-year-old, vegetarian concert of Jacksonville, Florida.
I used to see my black-fashioned hives against a pair of brown leather and a rocket in the other direction of government that I couldn't even see.
That was the first time I was in Afghanistan.
I've been working with war for a long time, but with Pyjama party and football play and trade with a non-governmental South-American and academic protisties who live with the non-governmentalism and Afghanistan and the rest of Afghanistan and the world, and I knew what I knew before I knew what I knew before I knew.
But this is the geography of self.
And so I'm here, I'm here, a local Afghai, South African-state-state-state-state-state-state-state-state-stateistist, a radical political artist who's been working on the last nine years in Afghanistan, and created.
So there are many great things in Afghanistan that you could do art, but I personally don't want to paint rainers. I want to make art that compides the personalities and authority and re-created reality and re-organized, and actually used a kind of creative peoples to try to understand the world.
I want to spend a day in life of jihad -- a woman who's been using jihad against criminalists like "Bopop" and armed religious and armed to treat political corruption.
And whatever else can the jihad do as a choice for Parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan: "Do I do jihad." I'm rich."
And trying to use this campaign to let these Mariiosi who spend as a national superheroes.
I want to go to the corruption in Afghanistan, with a project called "Rove," which is a police officer, a false control on the streets of Kabul and cars, instead of taking money from them, and taking money to the police in Kabul, and they hope that they hope that they would help us to take 100 percent of Afghanistan.
I'd like to look at what conflict in Afghanistan has become the World War of the World War.
The war and the stranger that came to him, created a new environment for St.C. and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion for soldiers and suicide bombers, where I was in a local slave, or a bunch of seged, or a bunch of segregate in a non-friendly, or a non-contite.
And I'd like to see how a simple band of Kabul between Kragellowowow, to create a dialogue about it today's development of developing European dictatorship, in the past-discovered protesters of the White House, and to protect it a lot of brown man in their own.
But for all these things, you can get into jail, they can be misunderstood, misprovenly.
But I do it because I have to do it because the geography of self-esteem requires it.
This is my burden. What's your?
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell Russell, and I've been working for a model for a while.
For 10 years, it's exactly what I said.
I feel that there's a feeling that I've been able to make a more unconpilled tension in the room, because I wouldn't have to wear that dress.
Fortunately, I have something to change with it.
This is the first time that someone in the TED stage is to join you, so you can appreciate this, and I think.
If a couple of women were really mutated when I came out, you don't need to say this now, I'll read about Twitter later.
I also think that I'm quite privileged because I can change in very short 10 seconds of what you think of.
It doesn't have any chance to do that.
These spines are very uncomfortable, it's good that I didn't want to wear them anyway.
The most difficult part is to pull the shail over my head, because you'll all be fired, so you'll do nothing, just as long as it's over my head.
All right.
Why did I do this now?
It was embarrassing.
Well, it wasn't that easy to be as uncomfortable as this picture.
It's a picture of a visual, but a picture is also a super-cus.
I've just changed your opinion in six seconds.
And this is a picture -- I never had a friend.
I felt very uncomfortable, and the photographer told me I should put my back oil and put my hand in the hair of this guy.
And besides surgery or the wrongest thing that I've been able to do for two days ago, there are very few opportunities to change our fears, and our fears, although it's a huge impact on our lives.
It's not to be honest for me today.
And I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
I'm on this stage because I'm a nice white woman, and I call this a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but the honest way.
The first question is, "How do you do a model?"
I say, "Oh, I've discovered," but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became a model is a profit in the genetic pandemic and a important legacy, and maybe you might ask yourself what this legacy is.
Now, in the last few centuries, we have beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical, and we're programmed by the recognition of it, but also as big, sin, rap and bright ones.
This legacy was created for me. And it's a legacy that's been given to me.
I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical about this point, and maybe some fashionists like, "Haltie. Naol, Tyra, Tyan. Joan Smw.
And first, I'm talking about your model. Very impressive.
But unfortunately, I have to tell you that in 2007, a very ambitious Ph.D. student at NYU, all the modifications of the time, every single person that was being taken, and that 67-7-7-month-creaters were only less than four percent.
The next question that's always going to ask me is, "Can I become a model if I'm grown?"
And I say, "I don't know that's not in my responsibility."
But the second answer I really want to give you these little girls is, "Why?
You know what? You can all be.
You can be president of America or the inventor of the next Internet or a Ninstian psychiatric expert, which would be absolutely wrong, because you'd be the first."
When they say this amazing re-cussing, "No, Cameron, I want to be a model," I say, "Who do my boss."
Because I have no responsibility for nothing, and you could be the chief of American bird or the business leader of H<unk>amp;M. or the next Steven Meis.
And I say that you want to say a model later, that's like, you'd say that you'd want to get the Jackto vaccine.
It can't affect it, and it's fantastic, and it's not a career.
Now I'm going to show you 10 years of a model of design, because unlike heart surgery, it can only be able to be able to do it.
If there's a photographer there, and the light is exactly there, like a nice balloon, and the driver says, "Cadon, we want to run a photo on the box," then the leg goes up, and it's pretty long, and it's on the back to the back, and you're moving back to the head of three-quarters, and you're just going to get it up to 300 friends, and then you'll see it'
It looks like this.
And I hope that's less weird than that in the middle.
It was -- I don't know what's going on there.
If you're going to go to school and you've done a lot of jobs, and you're not going to say a lot more, and if you say that President American American wants to be the U.S. but you're looking at the life, "Tirty years of labor."
The next question that I've been asked is, "Who are all the photos going to be insacted?"
And yes, all the photos are being replicated, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This is the first photo I did, and that was also the first time I had a Bikini. I didn't even have my time.
I know that's going to be pretty personal, but I was a young girl.
So I just saw a couple months before I was with my grandmother.
I'm this day of this Shart.
My friend had to join me.
I'm on a Pyjama party, a couple days before a Shollime for French bird.
I'm with the football team and the New Yorker magazine.
And I'm here today.
And I hope you can see that these pictures aren't images of me.
It's constructing, and it's a group of professionals, from Havalronists and design engineers and photographers and the staff and the staff and the administrators and the post-engineering. They build it. That's not me.
Okay, next, people always ask me, "Kould you do things for free?"
Yes, I have too many 20-foot shoes that I can't wear, except the things I get free are things that I'm going to get in real life and don't like to talk about it.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a store in a store, and I had lost my money, and you had a dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I went to my friend, a terrible driver, and she stopped a red light bulb, and of course it took me to say, "I've got a -- "Mrit, Mr. Teszler, Mr. Teszler," and we've been able to go further.
I've got these costless things because of my appearance, and I've got people with my personality, and there are people who pay attention to their appearance and not for their personality.
I live in New York, and from 140,000 teenagers who were stopped in the last year and filtered by 85 percent black black black and Latino and most young men.
They live in New York only 17,000 young young, black and Latino, who don't ask the question, "Who am I going to stop?"
"How often do I stop? When am I going to stop?"
I found myself in my research for this talk that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes up to 17 percent if they've become 17 percent.
And the last question is, "How is it a model?"
And I think they're expecting this answer, "If you're a little bit cute and glowing hair, you feel very happy and great."
And then we give a answer that might give this impression.
We say, "It's really great to travel so much, and it's great to work with creative, passionate people."
It's true, but it's just half of the story, because what we never say before the camera, which I've never said before is, "I feel helpless."
And I feel uncomfortable because I have to think about my appearance every day.
And if you'd ever ask yourself, "Do I feel happier if I had thin legs and glowing hair?"
And then you should meet a couple of logs, because they have the cute legs and the most bright hair and the cool ones, and they're probably the most vulnerable women on the planet.
When I was preparing this talk, it was very difficult to move me to a more honest balance, because at the other hand I felt very uncomfortable about this, and say, "I got all the benefits from a pile that I had to get in a pile of mine that's not so upset." And it doesn't feel very good to make me feel so happy."
It was very difficult to open a legacy of violence and race when I'm one of the biggest users of it.
But I'm also happy, and I'm happy to be here, and I think it's great, and I think I've done it before 10 or 10 years before I've been able to be a career, and my career was still not going to tell me how my first job was going to tell me, or maybe I would not get paid to talk about what's so important.
If you take something from this talk, hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our misporters and misproven.
Thank you.
I never forget the words of my grandmother who came to life in the ex-fat, "Son, poyi's Gafi resistance.
But I'm never going to be like a Gafafi revolution."
There's nearly two years since the Dutch revolution was released, inspired by the waves of mass mass-fires and both in the Egyptian revolution.
I started with a lot of other nies, and outside and outside of the anger, to challenge a tsunami against the tyrant regime.
And it was there, a big revolution.
Young, grand women and men in the first row, the end of the regime, said, "Pogis of freedom, dignity and social justice in the air.
They proved that they have shown a lot of courage by asking them to be a war of the brutal dictators of Gafafis.
They've shown a strong sense of solidism, from the far east to the far west, to the south.
After a period of six months of brutal war, almost 50,000 dead, we managed to let our country and to break the tyranny.
Gafi has left a great worker, a legacy of the tyranny, corruption and the foundation of the course of the course of the course.
Over four decades, Gaddafis's legislators had the infrastructure and the infrastructure, as well as the culture and the moral structure of the pink society.
The destruction and the challenges, I realized how many other women are going to build the civil society of Lay<unk>s Australia. We asked a foreign and a re-preated transition to democracy and general.
Oare organizations have been developed in 200 institutions, and immediately after the case of Gafisis in Benghahaz, almost 300 in Tripolis.
After 33 years in the exile, I came back to Lybans, and I started to organize programs with unique enthusiasm to learn computer skills, human development and leadership.
And with a wonderful group of women, I started the peace platform of Congysian women, a movement of women, leaders, leaders, their goal, is to engage publicly for the sociologistianity of women and to the right-being of peace and democracy.
I met the elections in a very difficult environment, a environment that became increasingly polarized. A community that was defined by the selfish politics of dominance and determination.
I led a initiative to peace platform, and a leader of peace-based women to achieve a legal driver, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what the background should be, and to choose the right, and to vote with a political leader between a female and female and female, and a broad-level, and a broad-level, and then to make it a difference.
And finally, our initiative was taken up and successful.
Women won 175 percent of the nation's national government in the first elections since 52 years.
But unfortunately, the euctic of elections and the whole revolution was, because every day we were looking for new messages of violence.
And a morning, we went to the post-cermiation of ancient mosques and Sufi actors.
And then a day, we got messages about the murder of American ambassador and attack on the message.
And then again, another morning, the bomgers were attacked by the army.
And in fact every day we're in the leadership of the Milbs and their relationship with the human soldier and their preconventions of laws and laws.
Our society, from a revolutionary spirit, polarized, and moved from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice that they finally had.
Anchance, disregoration and r<unk>amp;Rormed, the iva Age of the revolution.
I'm not here today to inspire you with the success story of our re-excession and the elections.
In fact, I'm here today to announce that we have a nation that has the wrong choice and the wrong decisions.
We've done our priorities wrong.
Because the elections didn't bring peace or security in Lyia.
Did the re-incessive and the shift between female and male peace and national justice?
No, it doesn't.
So what is it?
Why will our society continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics and the opposition and the opposition of both men and women?
Maybe the women were not the only to miss, but the female values of compassion, the Gade and the opposition.
Our society needs a national dialogue and a consensus that it took the elections, which is the end of the polarization and the fragmentation.
Our society needs the interaction of the woman more than they need the logical, logical character.
We have to stop the name of anger and ask a day of a hell.
We've got to start to act in the name of compassion and the rest of the river.
We have to develop a female discourse that doesn't just claim to the values, but also to be re-quanted, that Gehood instead of a rawer, cooperation rather than competition, instead of a competition.
These are the ideals that need a war-in-white nose to achieve peace.
Because peace has a alchemie and in those alchemie, it's about the interfinational of the feminist and butterflies's view.
It's the real thing.
And we need to do that in general, before we do it sociologically.
An out of the Koran, the "Salam," "The God's word of the Good God, hawhe."
The word "rave" again, which is known in all the lateham Church, has the same Arab root as "The Elephant" "mear" and symbolically symbolically symbolically symbolized by the soul that is surrounded by humanity, the man's soul, the female and the female and all the tribes have been all over.
And just like the mother's elbow in the embryo that grows in it, almost the reason of compassion is the whole existence of compassion.
And so we told us, "My God's always put things."
And so we told us, "My Goyid has been a pre-discovered in front of my sweet."
And we all have the art of the Galte.
Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best world, and I grew up with the song "NG" to be "The Wait."
And I was very proud.
We're in school, we're looking at the story of Kiml, but we didn't learn a lot about the world outside there, except America, South Korea, Japan and Japan are our enemies.
Although I often wondered how the outside world is, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea until there was a different shift.
When I was seven years ago, I saw a public approach, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor, and I never had to suffer.
But in 1993, my mother brought a letter from a colleague of mine.
And it was like, "If you were going to get this up here, our five family members of the world will not be because we've eaten for two weeks.
We're all in the ground, and our bodies are so weak that we'll die."
I was so shocked.
I heard that for the first time, people in my country were suffering.
Shortly, I went to the station, and I saw something horrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A black woman was on the ground, and a little kid in her arm, smelling in the face of his mother.
But nobody helped them because all of them were busy to care about themselves and their families.
In the mid-'70s, there was a big famine in North Korea.
At the end, more than a million North Koreans were to love the war, and many more people have ever survived because they eat grass, beetles and tree lions.
And the electricity are increasingly, so it's always been, at night, that it's all kind of slipped me, except the lights of China on the other side of the gang that we've lived with.
I always wondered why they had lights there, and we didn't.
This is a satellite image of North Korea and his neighbors at night.
This is the river of the inades, which is part of the border between North Korea and China.
You can see the river is very profound and allow North Bronx to escape.
But many dieed die.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the river.
I can't say a lot about how I left North Korea, but I can say that while the devastating majority of the war was sent to the dead relatives of China.
I just thought that I would be separated from a short time of my family.
I'd never think it takes 14 years to work.
In China, it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family.
I had no idea of how life would be like North Bronx refugees, but soon I realized it's not just very difficult, but it's very dangerous, because North Korea are going to be seen by illegal refugees in China as illegal refugees.
So I lived in complete fear that my real identity could fly, and you would send me back to a terrible destiny to North Korea.
And one day, my biggest alnock room was true when I got caught by the Chinese police and got into the police department.
Somebody told me to be North Bronx, so they tested my Chinese allies, and I had many questions.
I had this fear, I thought my heart would explode.
If you're immortal, anything seems to be immortal, I could be locked up and be rejected.
I thought that would be the end of my life, but I made my feelings to control my emotions and answer questions.
After they've been done with the questions, a leader said to the other, "This was a false issue.
It's not North Bronx."
And they left me. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans, in China, they're post-state messages, but many of them are caught by the Chinese police and they're signed.
These girls were having great luck.
Although they got caught, they finally got out of tremendous international pressure.
These North Koreans did not have so much luck.
Every year, North Korea are collected, and they're reported in China, and they're reported to North Korea, where they're being replicated or publicly or publicly.
Although I had a lot of North Carolina, I had this.
It's tragic that North Koreans hide their identity and have to fight hard to survive.
And as they've learned a new language and work, their world can be asked in a moment in a moment.
After 10 years of the pig, I decided to go to South Korea, and again I started a new life.
I was in South Korea, I was a bigger challenge than I thought it was.
English was so important in South Korea that I had to start to learn my third language.
And I've been able to see the big difference between North and South Korea.
We're all Korean, but inside, we've been very diverged by a series of layers, because of 67 years of part of the part.
I was walking through a identity crisis.
Am I North or North Carolina?
Where do I come from? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that could have been my home.
Although my adaptation was not easy to notice the South Korean life, I had a plan.
I was preparing for the recording interview at the University.
Just as I was born in my new life, I got a scary call.
The North Bronx Administration started to get the money that I sent to my family, and as a punishment, my family was forced to move to a remote place on the country.
So they had to run so quickly, so I started to plan their escape.
North Koreans have to go back to a tremendous route to the path of freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, ironically, I took a flight back to China, and I made myself to the way to the Northwest border.
Because my family didn't speak Chinese, I had to set them up, over 2,000 miles from China, and then after South Asia.
The bus was taken a week, and we've been getting caught almost a lot.
Once the bus was sent to a Chinese police officer,
And he took the evidence of all, and started asking questions.
There's no Chinese dreams, I thought they'd be arrested.
When the Chinese officer gave me my family, I decided to say that they were a child, and I was a senior person.
He looked at me in a wonderful way, but luckily, he believed me.
And we managed to get to the high-grained border, but I had to put all my money to the border of L.R. from L.R.
But even after we've been covering the border, my family was replicated because of illegal border.
After I paid money sentence and paid money, my family was released in a month ago, but shortly after my family, in the capital of Lonia.
This was one of the largest distractions of my life.
I've done everything to protect my family freedom, and we've been so close, but my family was just taken up just before the south-fadanian message.
I went and forth between the foreign authorities and the police authorities, trying to let my family to let me, but I didn't have enough money to pay money to pay money or money.
I lost all my hope.
And then the voice asked me to ask a man, "What's going on?"
I was absolutely surprised that a stranger is about it.
In broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained my situation and without a bank, and paid money for my family and two North Koreans to get out of jail.
And I was thank him about the very well-being and I said, "Why are you helping me?"
"I don't help you," he said.
"I teach the North Bronx people."
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The people who have been born by the past, as a new hope, that the North Koreans needed so much, and he showed me the intellectuality of strangers and the support of international community as the hope of the hope that the North Koreans need.
And then after our long journey, my family and I moved back to South Korea, but the freedom of getting a step.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and once they get into a new country, they start to start with little money or no money.
The international community can help us in education, the English learning and education and a lot more.
We can also change the bridge between the people in North Korea and the outside world, because many of us still stay in contact with families, and we send them information and money that helps North Korea to change.
I was so lucky to get a lot of help and inspiration in my life, that I want to be a hopeful North Carolina to commit success with international support.
I'm sure you'll see a lot more successful North Koreans around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I've just got a request today.
Please don't tell me that I am normal.
So I'm going to show you my brothers.
It's 22, and it's very good.
He can't talk about it, but he's communicating joy in a way that some of the best speakers might not be the best speaker.
Remi knows what love is.
It's a lot of it, and it's connecting it to it.
It's not a stupid. He's not looking at the skin color.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and you just imagine it: He never told a lie.
When he's singing songs from our childhood, it's trying to talk to words that I don't even remember, he reminds me about one thing: how little we know about the mind, how wonderful the unknown.
He's 16. He's very good.
It's a absolutely unconqueness memory.
It also has a selective one.
He can't remember if he stolen my chocolate cake, but he reminds me of the paper year of every song on my iPod, conversations that we had when he was four, while the first result of the teopetet on my arm and Lady Gagas.
Don't they hear incredible?
But a lot of people don't agree.
And in fact, their mind doesn't fit into the social version of normal, they often get over and understood and wrong.
But what my heart encouraged me and my soul was that although it was the case, although they were not considered as usual, that only one could mean that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those of you who are not so familiar with the term "creat" -- it's a complex disorder of the brain, the social communication that's influenced learning and sometimes physical abilities.
It's in every individual, and it's sort of like Sam.
And the world is going to be discovered every 20 minutes of autism in a new human autism, and although one is the fastest growing adult disabilities in the world, there's no known cause of law or cure.
And I can't remember the first time I'm in autism, but I can't remember it any day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother was born, and I was so excited that I had a new creature in my life.
And after a few months, I realized that he was different.
He was very upset.
He didn't want to play the other babies, and in fact he didn't really care about being interested in me.
Remi lived and he was living in his own world with his own rules, and he found joy of the smallest things, like cars in the room, and putting the washing machine into a row, and eating everything that came out of it.
And as he became older, it became different and the differences of the differences.
But behind the anger and the shaman and the never finish-up hyperactivity, something really unique: a single and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without contradictions, a human being.
Amazing.
Well, I can't deny that there were some more challenging moments in my family, moments of moments that I wish they were exactly like me.
But I'm going to go back to the idea of the things that they've taught me about individual quality, communication and love, and I understand that these are things that I wouldn't want to deal with normality.
The normality of beauty that gives us the differences, and the fact that we're different is not that one of us is wrong.
It just means that there's a different way of right.
And if I could only say one thing to Sii and to Sam and you, you would be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or non-religual, the differences we have -- we have a gift! Everybody of us have a gift in it, and all of us, and all of the honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate criminal victims.
The chance of scale, progress and change in the moment that we try to be like somebody else.
Please -- don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Doc Edpton, we've been mad with pride and curiosity, with this photo, with a third-old apple, and with a mass-time period of a million times.
But now 50 years later, we're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion, but a trillion images per second.
I'm going to show you a new kind of photography, the Femto-Dold photography, a new engineering technique that's so fast that it can create time-time comrapse images of light.
And so we can build cameras that look at the outside of our view of corners or not a <unk>-ray in our body, and actually ask what we're doing with "D camera."
Now, if I take a laser back and put it in a billionth of a second, and I can -- these are several megs of a couple of tweets -- I'll make a package of photons that are hardly a millimeter, and this photographs, this project will turn into light, and it's going to turn into speed of light, and say, a million times faster than a year.
So if you take this project, these photons of a satellite package and you put it in this bottle, how are these photons going to break into the bottle?
What's the light going on in time is slow?
So this whole event --
So you think that's actually going to take a little bit less event in the process of this event -- so long as it takes the light to get that route -- but I'm going to get this video to the number of billions of dollars so you can see the light in motion.
No, Coca-Cola didn't fund this research.
So in this film, a lot of happens, so let me analyze this, and show you what happens.
Our project, our project, goes into the bottle with a photodlet, which starts to move through and then melt the inside.
Part of the light is turning back to the table, and you see this spread of waves.
Many of the photons are finally able to get the wheel and explode in different directions.
You can see there's a air bubble that's going to be in the bottle.
And meanwhile, the waves on the table are on the table, and because of the reflection of the top, you see that the reflection of the bottle is focused on some images.
Now, if you take a common project and let it back the same route and then take the video back to 10 billion, you know how long you've got to sit here to see the film?
A week a week? No, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- from a slow, normal project in movement.
And what does it look like to be a little still-time photographer?
You can see the waves on the table, the Tomteorite and the wall in the back of the back.
It's like you put a stone in a pond.
It looked like nature looked like this, every single-to-one picture, but of course our eyes are together with a single picture.
But if you look at this Tom's Day, you'll see that when the light hits the Tom's slide, that's not going to remain. It's not going to be dark.
Why is that? Because the Tom's going on and it's going to be in and it's going to be coming back and over again for a couple of seconds.
So in the future, if this tap camera is built in your Camerahahandy, it could be possible to go to a supermarket and find if a fruit is a fruit, no one, no one's going to touch them.
So what did my team at MIT build this camera?
So as a photographer, as a photographer, you know, if you're doing a photo with a short-term mass of mass destruction, you've got very little light, but we're going to get a billion times faster than your short-term mass, so you'll get that kind of light.
So what we're doing is we're sending this project, this photons of these photons, a million, and then we're going to draw it back and combine it with very clever synchronically, and we're going to combine these gigabytes of data to create these little video videos that I've shown you.
And we can take all these raw data data and do very interesting things.
So Superman can fly.
Other heroes can make invisible, but how about a new superpower for a future super-grand beings: can see hidden corners?
The idea is that we're going to make something light on the door.
It's going to be replicated, in space, a part of it will be turned back to the door, and then eventually back to the camera, and we could use these more extractions of light.
And that's not science fiction. We've actually built it.
You see our Femto camera.
It's a tap behind the wall, and we'll let the light into the door.
After our paper was published in the International Communicications Institute, it was taken by Nature Nature.com, and they've created this animation.
We're going to be able to put these light-based data and then you'll get them back to the wall and then put these photons in all directions and some of the photons will be able to get our hidden glass, and then the lights will break the light, and then then the door will turn a tiny bit of light and a tiny neuron into the blue pixons, and then they'll get to the very interesting part of the other.
And because we have a camera that's so fast -- our Femto camera has some unique abilities.
It has a very good time of it, and it can look at the world in light speed.
And of course, we know the distance to the door, but also the hidden objects, but we don't know what's heard of what's going on.
So by taking a laser, we can take a pipe image that -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense, but if we take lots of these images, dozens of these images, and then we try to analyze the different light-controlled light-based processes, then we can see the object?
Can we see it in 3D?
So here's our development.
We've done a lot of things before we can do this in the lab, we can actually use cars that are collected, and see what's behind the curve, or we can search with dangerous survivors by looking for us to look at light, or we can build the window, or we can build the back-up wall of the body in the deep air and down the back of the air.
But because of the blood and tissue, of course, this is a very challenging, which is really a "pight" for scientists, now think about FFFFTold photography, because a new visual process could actually solve the next generation of medical problems.
So, like Docpton, even a scientist, science has become a art of the ultra-dimensional photography, and I realized that all these gigabytes of data that we've been collecting every time, not only the scientific process. We can create a new form of paint camera photography, and we can't look at that color of color and then we can't look at that layer of time.
But it's also something weird here.
If you look at those waves under the bag, you can see that the waves of us move away.
The waves should be to move us.
What's going on here?
It turns out that we've been able to take almost in light speed, weird effects, and Einstein would love to see this picture incredibly amazing.
The order that happens in events in the world is that the camera is in a way that's going to be able to make a relationship between space and time, we can apply these biases.
So, whether it's a piece of photography around the outside, or the design of a new visual tool for medicine or new interfaces, since our invention, we've been able to have all the data and details on our website, and hope that the profinators, the creative community, and the research community, we should try to stop the next micro-dimensional micro-dimensional imagery, and start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start
It's time. Thank you.
There are many opportunities that we humans can improve our lives.
We don't meet every neighbors on the street so many people don't get passed, but we use the same public spaces.
I've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a box and a circle of chalk.
The projects came from my questions, how much renters are driving my neighbors?
How do we borrow more things without complaining to each other?
How can we share our memories on the back buildings and understand the landscapes better?
And how do we share our hopes for free homes so that our communities are changing our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I love New Orleans.
My soul is being disrupted by the vast eaves that have been given hundreds of years of loving love and white shadows. I trust a city where there's always music.
I think every time you never, there's a parade in New Orleans.
And in this city, some of the most beautiful buildings in the world, but it's also the city with most of the rests of the poor ladies in America.
I live near this house and thinking about how I can make it happen, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I lost somebody I loved in 2009,
Her name was Joan, and she was like a mother for me. She suddenly came to death and unexpectedly.
I've been thinking about death, and I felt a great gratitude for my life, and it made me clarity about things that are now important in life.
But it's hard to keep that view every day.
It's easy to lose in everyday lives and forget what's really important.
And with the help of old friends and new friends, I turned a side of the house to a huge box, and I wrote a branch of the gaps: "I want to die," I want to get bananas, everyone who can come to come to a piece of chalk and think about your own lives.
I wasn't sure what I could expect in the experiment, but the next day, the wall was completely filled, and it grew up.
I'm going to share some sentences with you that were written in the wall of people.
I'm going to argue about piracy."
I'm going to argue about the International News's data line."
"I want to sing for millions of people."
I'm going to die with a tree."
I'm going to die with "weet"."
I'm going to die, I'd like to keep it in my poor."
I'm going to die with somebody's work."
I'm going to die with myself."
This incident was reported in a meaningful place, and the hopes and dreams of people, to laugh, to the wine and to me as the hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone.
It's about understanding our neighbors, and it's a new and more inclusive way.
It's about creating space for us and thinking and remember what's most important to us as we grow and change.
I did this last year, and I've received hundreds of the messages of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with her community, so my colleagues and I've built a building software and now have been built in countries like Kazanan, Australia, Australia, Australia, other walls.
And we've shown how much power of our public spaces, when we have the opportunity to cross our voices and share more with others.
The most valuable things we have are time and relationships to other people.
In a world with more interfinations, it's more important than ever before, looking at things with the right sight and thinking that life is short and sensitive.
We're often accustomed to talk about death, or even to think about it, but I've realized that the effort is to keep the death of one of the things that most of us are.
The idea of death is that we think about life.
Our common places are the best of us, and as individuals, as a community, and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories that people can't help us to help us to create better places, to help us live better.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So I'm involved with more than a lot of math, a special problem for anyone who's been involved with more than corporations.
No one knows what we're doing.
So I'm going to try to try to explain what I do today.
It's a human activity.
We're just excited about the painting of a master-pine ball and the hives, as you'll see.
Now, if you're a remarkable amount of knowledge and abilities, and maybe a fundamental signal that could have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurologic disorders are destroyed as Parkinson's potential. It also makes me look at my foreign guardes, which was a ball accident that was time to be a ball accident.
And over the years, you've done a lot of progress in treatment.
Yet, over the world, there are 6.3 million people who suffer in this disease, and they have to live with the unconventable symptoms of weakness, patility, mortility and other others who are causing this disease, so we need the objective to discover the disease before it's late.
We need to measure progressively, and ultimately the only possibility is to know if there is cure, if we have an objective measure that can answer this question.
And in trouble, it's because it's a system for Parkinson's disease and other movements, so you can't do simple blood analysis. The best thing is that this 20-minute test is in neurologists.
You have to do it in the hospital. It's very expensive, and that means that outside clinical studies will never do it. Never.
But what if patients could do this test at home?
It would be a professional tour in the hospital. What if patients could do this test themselves?
It wouldn't be a brander hospital.
By the way, 300 percent is to study in the neurological area.
So I want to suggest you a non-governmental method that we're trying to do that, because we're all certain in some sense, virtual, virtual, like my Janriver.
So here's a video of the vibrant vocal lobets.
And this is what happens in the healthy state when someone is creating a speech sign. We can look at a crazy baller because we have to coordinate all these motor organs, if we're making a sound, and we've got all the genes for the MacP.
And like ballet, it requires a lot of practice.
Think about how long a child needs to talk to it.
We can look at the position of the sensor-sensitive vocal muscles, and as the limbs are also affected by Parkinson's brain.
The bottom line is that you can see an example of irregular vocal feedback.
We're always seeing the same symptoms.
It's a real, weakness, pissility.
The language will be more and more blind and more and more, and this is an example of the scriptoron.
Now, this impacts can be minimal, sometimes with digital microphones and general analysis, combined with new machine learning that's now advanced, we can now see where somebody is in a pubid between disease and disease, just by the ball of brain.
How can these tests measure clinical trials? Well, they're both non-terrorist. The test of neurologists.
It's so little. The infrastructure have already been there.
You don't have to build new clinics for that.
And they're exactly exactly. They're not doing the right list of experts.
So you can do it yourself.
They're very fast, take 30 seconds.
They're very cheap, and we know what that means.
If something very cheap is, you can use it in a large scale.
So this amazing goals are now to do with this.
We can reduce logical difficulty for patients.
Patients don't have to take a routine control in the hospital.
We can gain objective data through common observation.
We can do cheap mass training for clinical trials, and first of all the population is going to be able to do real-time.
So we've been looking for the opportunity to look for biomarkers for the disease before it's too late.
Now, we're going to do the first step in this direction, we're going to start to start the Parkinson's disease-based.
We want to take a very high number of voices around the world to have enough vehicles to pay attention to the goals.
We have a reputation number of millions of people on this planet.
Every one with no disease, can call cheaply, record pictures for a few cents. I'll talk to you about joy, that we've already done six percent of our target in only eight hours.
Thank you.
If you're looking at samples, we're going to say 10,000 people, you can tell who they're healthy and who's not?
What do you do with all these samples?
What's happened is that the patient has to tell you if this person is suffering in Parkinson's disease or not. OK.
Some will not be able to do it until the end.
But we collect a huge database, under different circumstances, which is interesting. These conditions are important because we are to figure out what the actual markers are for Parkinson's disease.
At the time, you have 86 percent accuracy?
It's much better.
My students Thisia -- I have to put it up because he did this fantastic work -- now it's also done about the mobile network, which is the project that allows us to do this project, and we're at 99 percent accuracy.
I call this a improvement.
That means that people can call -- people can call a phone phone phone and call the test. People could call Parkinson's voice so that their doctor can check the progress of the disease.
Exactly.
Thank you. Max Small, ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you, Tom.
I live here. I live in Kenya in the south of the Nairobi National Park.
You see the cows of my father and the one behind the kitchen is the Nairobi National Park.
The Beijing Park is just in the south, and that means that wild animals can leave the park in any time.
The predators, the lions, follow them, and then they do this.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of our cows that killed at night. I woke up in the morning, and it found it dead. It was horrible. It was our only Haker.
My tribe, the tribe of the massai, believe that we came together with our animals and the Treasureland of the sky, so our animals care so much.
I learned lions in the same time.
Our warrior is called Morans. They protect our stem and our native. They're also also also involved because of this problem.
They kill lions.
This is one of six lions that were killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's because there's only so many lions in Nairobi National Park.
My tribe is a boy between six and nine years old for the cows of his father, so it was also me.
I had to find a solution.
My first idea was fire. lions fear fire.
But then I realized that this would not really help us, but the lions help to see the cows better.
But I didn't have to go. I kept doing it.
I had a second idea. I tried to take it with a bird.
I wanted lions to think about it next to the cow.
But lions are very smart animals.
You can see the bird posts and go back and go back. The next time, and they come and say, this thing doesn't really move, that's still there.
And they're going to take away and kill our livestock.
I was in a night, I was watching the pall. I went to a pubch and put it around the hand, and this time the lions didn't catch it.
And lions are afraid of light that moves.
I had an idea.
I was working on this whole day as a young boy, and I was working all day in my room, and once I did the new radio, and the day she got me to get almost about electronics.
I took a old car battery and a driver-to-driving car. The one shows whether you want to turn to the right or the left, and it's a hysterical.
And I got a switch to turn the lights and turn it up.
This is a little egg from a broken box lamp.
And then I built all together.
The solar mushroom is drained the battery that takes electricity to the right-effective plant. I call it a transite.
And the right-sensitive plant is ticked.
You see that the lightning is coming out because the lions come from there.
And this is what it looks like for lions when they come.
The lights are flashing and lions believe that I'm going to the pall. And that's what I was in bed all the time.
Thank you.
So I've been in this room in home, and since I've had no problems with lions.
And then our neighbors stopped it.
One of them was this grandmother.
She lost a lot of animals in lions, and she asked me if I could install their lights.
And I said, "Yes."
I put the lights. You can see lions in the background.
Since then, I've been feeding seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights and they're doing well.
My idea is now used in Kenya, including other predators like hygiene or leopards, and the lights are also used to keep elephants from the sea.
My invention is to give me a scholarship to a senior school in Kenya, Brookhouse School School, and I'm really excited.
My new school is engaged and helps to participate by corporate research.
I even brought my friends home and we build the lights there where there's no other, and I'm going to show people how to use it.
I was just a boy from the savanna, who was hiring cows. I saw planes about me and said, "I'm going to be sitting in a box."
And I'm here today.
I was able to put a plane with my first TEDTalk.
When I'm big, I want to be an airplane engineer and pilot. That's my great dream.
I used lions, but by my invention, I can save the cows of my father and the lions, we can live together with side, with lions, without arguments.
Ol Ol Olnn. In my language, that means that: Thank you very much.
You don't know how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got this scholarship. Yes.
You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next list?
So my next invention, now I work on a electrical fence. A single electrojection?
Yes, I know electrical kale have been invented for a long time, but I want to have my own.
You've been trying to do it again, not true, yeah, I've tried to try to get back to it, but I got a break -- I got a catch.
It's hard. Richard Turder, you're special.
We're going to hire you to raise your heads, my friend.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm old enough to keep a camera in my hand, photography is my passion. But today I want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures, and no one of them.
There was no kind of director, no styleist, no chance to shoot a picture. Not even has been replicated by the lighting.
To be honest, most of the people were shot by the protesters.
My story begins as I was a talk in New York, and my wife made this picture that I put on her first birthday on my arm. We were at the corner of 57 and five.
And so in New York, a year later, we were back to New York, and so we decided to shoot the same picture again.
Well, you can see what's going on there.
When the third birthday of my daughter said to me, "Hey, why do you want Sabina to New York, and you do a father-old lady's Day account to lead the ritual?"
And then we started asking a picture of us, and then we started asking a picture of ourselves.
You know, it's remarkable, like universal gesture, if you're a completely stranger, your camera is enough.
Nobody who said no one, and fortunately, nobody has ever been fled with our camera.
And then, we didn't know how much these travel would change our lives.
This journey has become very sacred.
This is just a couple of weeks after 9<unk>11, and I had to explain what happened to be a five-year-old.
These images are much more than just a moment or a certain journey.
They're also a possibility for us to keep time in October, and to change our time and how we've been born in a year, not just physically, but in general, to reflect.
Because whenever we do the same picture, our perspective of time, while it's always changing new spaces, I can see life with their eyes, as they deal with everything that they see.
This very intense time that we're spending with is something that we estimate and expect every year.
Last, while one of our travel, we went to a walk, and suddenly it's all over, it shows a red bomb to a white car store that they learned as a young kid, earlier travel.
And she told me about their feelings that she had been asked by five-year-old in exactly this point.
She said that she was reminded about how her heart was on the chest, when she saw nine years ago the store for the first time.
And now she looks at New York to high schools because she really wants to study in New York.
And I realized that it was clear: the most important thing we all create are memories.
And so I'd like to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious-controlled memory.
I don't know what it looks like to you, but besides those 15 pictures, I'm not at a very small family photo.
I'm always the one that makes the picture.
I'd like to encourage everyone here to come to the image and say, "Do you ask somebody?"
Thank you.
