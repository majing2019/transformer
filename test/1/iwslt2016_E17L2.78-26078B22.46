When I was in my 20s, I had my first psychotherapy patient.
I was a PhD student and I studied clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
When Alex came to the first meeting, she wore jeans and a well-educated top, and she fell on the sofa in my office, she was dragging her sandals of hers and she told me she was there to talk about men's issues.
And when I heard that, I was relieved.
So my classmates got a racing officer as the first patient.
And I got a woman in the 20s who wanted to talk about boys.
I'll get that up, I thought.
But I didn't do it.
With the fun stories that Alex brought in the seat, it was easy for me to just trick with his head while we moved the problems ahead of us.
"30 is the new 20," Alex said, and as far as I could estimate it, she was right.
Work later, married, married came later, kids came later, even after death came later.
People like Alex in the 20s, and I didn't have time.
But soon my coach, Alex's love life started challenging me.
I stopped it.
I said, "Yes, she's dealing with men under their level, she's asleep with a flaws, but she's not going to marry him."
And my coach said, "Don't go for it, but maybe she's married to the next one.
And also, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is to work on the first time before she's married."
This is what psychologists call a-ha-ha moment.
That was the moment I realized that 30 aren't the new 20.
Yes, people later let home home as it was, but that was Alex's 20s not doing it for development.
This was Alex's 20s on the optimal development time, and we sat there and we refueled it.
And I realized that this kind of harmless neglection was a serious problem with real consequences. And just for Alex and her love lives, but for the careers, families and prospections of all the people in the 20s.
At this point, there are 50 million people in the United States, 50 million people in the 20s.
We're talking about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent, if you consider that no one is going to reach the adult age without going through the 20s.
Now, if you're in your 20s, if you're in your 20s.
I want to see some of you.
Oh yeah! You're all incredible.
If you work with someone in the 20s, you love to lose one in the 20s, I want to see you -- O.K. Great. People are really important in the 20s.
My specialty is people in the 20s, because I think every single one of these 50 million people should know what psychologists and sociologists know about, neurologists and fertility skills have long been the key to the 20s: one of the simplest and yet gorgeous things you can do for the work, for the love, for the happiness, even for the world.
That's not my view. These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the most unpredictable moments that happen in time to 35.
That means that eight out of 10 decisions, experiences and Aha-O-e experiences that make up your life, what it is until you're the middle 30, have already happened.
If you're not gay, if you're over 40 years old.
This group will go well, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a professional career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn.
We know that with 30 more than half Americans, more than they're married or live with the next partner or have a relationship with the future.
We know that the brain is going to be second and last big growing in the 20s, and propelled to the adult age, which means whatever you want to change to you, now is the time to do that.
We know that the personalities are changing as much as the people in their lives over the 20s, and that the fertility of women with 28 have at the peak, and that by 35 are getting complicated.
So in the 20s, you should continue to develop on the body and the capabilities that you've had in the 20s.
When we think about development of a child, we all know that the first five years of speech-playing and bonding in the brain is critical.
It's the time when ordinary, everyday life has a significant impact on the future.
But we hear very little about that there is something like adult development and our 20s critical time for it.
But they don't get people to hear it in the 20s.
The press talks about the time shift in adulthood.
Scientists call the 20s a more elevated puberty.
Journalists think of stupid nickname for people in the 20s like "Twixters," or "marids" child life.
That's right.
As a culture, we have validated what is now the critical decade for adulthood.
Leonard Bernstein said that big things are going to be achieved with a plan and a little bit of time.
You're not?
So what happens when you put someone in the 20s and say, "You get 10 years to make something out of your life?"
Nothing.
This person has been hijacked by the ambition and the urgency, and it's not happening at all.
And so every day, intelligent people come in, interesting people like her and your sons and daughters and daughters come to my office and say something like, "I know, my friend doesn't do well, but that relationship doesn't count. I'm just saying, "I'm not going to put the time."
Or they say, "All I've done with 30 years, as long as I've been able to start my career, everything's good."
But later, it sounds like this: "My 20s are almost over and I have no idea what to do.
I had a better life, and I had just completed college."
And then it sounds like this: "In my 20s, Participants was like the journey to Jerusalem.
Everybody went around and had fun, but then at the age of 30, the music started to get into place, and everyone started to settle.
I didn't want to be the only ones that stayed there, I sometimes think I married my husband because he was in my 30s the next chair."
Where are the people in the 20s here?
It's not power.
OK, it's easy to say, but it doesn't make any mistakes, because it's a lot of stuff.
If there's a lot of transport over the 30s, there's a huge pressure to start to launch a career quickly, to select a city, to have a partner and two children, in a much shorter time.
Many of these things are inconsistent, and like research results, they're just showing you tedious and stressful, all at once in the 30s.
The post-mathlife crisis doesn't mean buying a red sport car.
It means you can't do the career you want to do.
You can't see that this kid can't have that you want, or the child can't give birth and sisters.
Too many people in the '30s and 40s, looking at themselves and saying to me about their 20s: "What have I done there? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what people do in the 20s and think.
This is a story that shows how it can happen.
It's the story of Emma.
Emma came to my office when she was 25 because she suggested it, had an identity crisis.
She said she'd like to work in the art of art or at the Entertainment, but she didn't have decided yet, so she would have been deficient over the last few years.
Because the cheaper was, she lived with her friend who kept more his temporal weapons than his ambitions.
And even though their 20s were hard, their years were much worse before that.
She cried in the seat often, but then she gathered and said, "You can't pick your family, but your friends are already choosing."
One day, Emma came very upset and cried almost all the time.
She had bought a postbook, and she spent all the morning setting up her bag with a lot of contacts, but then she staring at the empty place that said, "Cake your close-heart please ..."
She was almost blind when she looked at me and said, "Who's going to be there for me if I have a car accident?
Who will feed me if I have cancer?"
And I had to sit down at that moment to say, "I."
But Emma didn't need physical therapist to really take care of her.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that was their chance.
I'd been learning too much since my first patient Alex to see how emperified email maskes were in favor for decades.
In the next weeks and months, I gave Emma three advice that every 20 year, no matter if men or woman should hear.
First of all, I told Emma that she had no identity crisis, she should rather be able to invent an identity capital capital.
And I said, "Well, you should look for something that she would keep doing.
Power, something that is an investment for you, invest in something you want to be next.
I didn't know about the email shop, and nobody knows what the future of the work looks like, but I know that identity capital creates capital capital capital capital capital.
So now, the time for this international job, this intern, this launch that you've been trying to do.
I don't get to see the discovery of the 20s, but already those who don't count, including the fact that they're not exploring.
That's procastination.
I said to Emma: Doctors know the work world, but do what drapea.
Second, I said, the urban spaces are overrated.
Good friends are prime to come to the airport, but 20s who are stacking together with people who think they're bound by who they know what they're thinking, how they think, how they talk, and where they're working.
This new, this new person, to recruit, is usually from outside of its own mode of view.
New things emerge from such a "the low-caczenities," from friends' friends' friends' friends' friends' friends.
It's true: half the 20s is underemployed or not at all.
But the other half is not, and weakities have put them there.
Half of the jobs have never been pushed off. So if you contact the boss's neighbor, it's not going to give you a fake job.
This is not a fraud. This is how information spreads.
The last advice: Emma believed that you couldn't pick the family, but the friends.
This was true when she grew up, but as 20s, she would soon pick up her own family when she turned out to a mate and started a family.
I told her the time, the time to choose a new family, would now be now.
You might think it's better to let yourself down than 20 or 25, and I agree with you.
But any one you're going to do when you're going to get stuck or alive in your life when everyone's married to Facebook is not progress.
The best time to plan your marriage is before you have one, and that means being as intentional in love as you're working with your work.
So to select your family, to consciously search and to search what you want, not because it works, or to select the time you've just chosen.
So what happened to Emma?
We went through her adage book, and she found the fellow fellowmates of a cousin working in a different state in a museum.
That weak band helped her get a job there.
This work message gave her the reason to leave her friend who she lived with.
Now, five years later, she's an event plan for museums.
She married a man who had accepted her.
She loves her new career and her new family, and she sent me a card, and she said, "Now the line is: "In case, don't turn on to the point, don't move too big."
And so, Emma's story sounds like everything is simple, but that's what I love for 20 years.
It's so easy to help them.
20 years of the design, like planned planes that are just leaving the airport and moving to the west somewhere.
It's when you start, a little approach can make a difference if you land in Alaska or in Fidschi.
That's equally true for 21 or 29 year-old, a good conversation, a great vacation, an inspirational TEDTalk can have a huge impact over years, and even over-term generations.
This is an idea that should reach all the 20s you know.
It's as simple as what I said to Alex.
I've had the privilege to share these 20 people like Emma every day: The 30s are not the new 20s, so you're going to engage in an identity capital, you're going to use your weak band to search your family yourself.
You're not exaggerating what you don't know or didn't.
You are just deciding about your life.
Thank you.
In the entire computer story, it was always our goal to shrink the distance between us and digital information, the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen, where we can live our imagination.
And that distance has gotten smaller, smaller and smaller and smaller, and now it's smaller than a millimeter, the thickness of a touch-shelf, and computers are accessible for everyone.
But I wondered what it would be like if there were no border at all.
I was imagining what that would look like.
I first developed this tool which is in the digital world, so if you press very hard on the screen, it will transform the physical character to pixel.
Designers can use their ideas right in 3D-materials and learners in virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, the border was broken.
But our hands are still left outside the screen.
How do we step in and interact with the digital information and use all the sensations of our hands?
I've developed with Microsoft Applied Sciences, along with my mentor Cati Boulank who re-engineered computers and a small room on the keyboard on a digital workplace.
And so it's by putting together a transparent screen and deep-sea cameras together to create the image of your fingers and face, you can now lift your hands up from the keyboard and reach your 3D, and touch your bare hands with the blinds.
There's a window and a file in the actual space, you can choose it as easily as you place a book from a shelf.
And then you can scroll through this book and tag words, and all of this on the virtual touchpad underneath each window.
Architects can actually extend and red and red with their models right with both hands.
So in these two examples, we're going to reach into the digital world.
But what if we turn around all this stuff and the digital information instead of reach us?
I'm sure many of you have had some experience how to buy articles online and come back later.
But now you don't have to worry about it.
Here I have a "Online encrypted tissue kideins."
This view is something that you can do through a head or through a transparent display, if the system understands the geometry of our body.
And I've started to think about this idea, and I've started thinking about looking at the pixels, not just in the room, but making them physical, so that we can touch them and feel them.
What would one of those future be like?
I've been with my consultant Hirishi Ishii and my collaborator Assorter Fori Post, made a real pixel.
Now, in this case, all of these panels act like a three-dimensional pixel in our world. That means that both computers and computers can move anywhere in this object, at least within this little 3D space.
And the effectiveness of that is that we've switched on gravity and control the movement by combining magnetic levitation, mechanical drive and these base technologies.
By programming the object digitally, we free it from the constraints of space and time, so that human movements can now be absorbed and closed and completely in the real world.
Like, Choreias can be taught over long distances or Michael Jordan's famous surfings can be reintroduced back and reintroduced into the real world.
Students can use this to use complex concepts like planet motion and physics, and unlike computer screens or textures, this is a real and physical experience that you can touch and feel and feel powerful, and it's very powerful.
And more exciting than just the things that we have right now in the computer, it's to imagine how programming the world will actually change our daily activities.
As you can appreciate, digital information will not only show us something, but start to interact with us as part of our physical environment, without dividing ourselves from our real world.
We've started today by talking about the limits, but if we remove that line, the only frontier is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained for two years to become a turner in Hunan, China, in the 1970s.
When I was in the first class, the government wanted to send me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid for cost.
But my mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to be an engineer like her.
After surviving the Industrial Revolution, they realized that the only way to happiness was safer and well-intentioned.
It's not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer.
That's me playing on my imaginary piano.
A opner singer is very early on with the Akrobatics training, so I tried everything to get to the opera school.
I even wrote the teacher in the instructor and the host of a wheel studio.
But the adults didn't like my idea.
The adults didn't think it was serious to me.
Only my friends were supportive, but they were just children, just as helpless as myself.
And when I was 15 years old, I knew that I was too old to start working with the training.
So my dream would never be true.
I was afraid that I could only hope for the rest of my life to be a lucky second choice.
But that's so unfair.
So I'd put myself in my head, and I'd find a different calling.
No one there to teach me something? Not too good.
So who was going to send books to me.
I left my hunger after the Congolese advice with this book about a writer and musician family. <unk>"Dour to the family of Fu Lei<unk> I found myself a role model in an independent woman, while the informal tradition of the Convention." <unk>Jave S<unk> I learned to be efficient in teaching me about this book.<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"1,000 books.
<unk>"Sanma's total<unk>"<unk>""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Of course, books that are prohibited in China.
"The good Earth" is about the life of Chinese farmers.
It's just not as propaganda. I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but odd.
But that's a theme for another time.
But the fifth commandment brought me a kind of epiphany: "You owe your father and your mother to honor."
"Dear," I thought, "That's so different and much better than the driver."
And that was my way of liberating myself from the infoating elimination of Indian guilt and transforming my parents' relationship.
and with a new culture encounter, I started reading the same way I did it.
This includes a lot of insights.
For example, I found this map doesn't actually get right because Chinese students grew up with this one.
It never occurred to me that China doesn't have to be in the center of the world.
So a card tells you something about the personal perspective.
The same way that you're reading comparatively is not new.
In the academic world, it's a standard process.
There are even research areas like counter-terrorism science and behavioral science.
Compared to the other hand, a complex understanding of a subject.
So I thought, well, what if you compare, how much is it worked in research, why not in everyday life?
So I started to read two books simultaneously.
They can act on people -- <unk>Benjamin Franklin from Walter Isaacson<unk>"<unk> John McCullough, from David McCullough, who were involved in the same event, or with friends with shared experiences.
<unk>"We had to print" by Katharine Graham <unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"<unk>"The Life is like a snowball" by Alice Schroeder." I also compare the same stories in various genres <unk> <unk>"King-Jene"<unk> "The Bible" by the Liff" by Christopher Moore" -- similar stories like Joseph's wonderful "Rob"<unk>amp;"<unk>amp;"<unk>s wonderful
At Christ, the attempt for economic policies, political and spiritual nature was the attempt.
In the Buddha, they were all psychological. It's funny, it's fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you master a language, it also makes fun to read the favorite books in two languages.
<unk>"Sinfony for a sea bird from Thomas Merton"<unk> <unk>"The Life of Taoia"<unk> to lose my translation instead of losing myself in translation, I found out how much I could gain.
For example, in translation, I've realized that "indure" in Chinese literally means "infect joy." Hork!
Free in Chinese is literally translating "negove Mother." Ohhh.
Like books are like a magical gate. I have a connection with the people of the past and the present.
I know I'm never going to feel lonely or feel helpless anymore.
A broken dream is really not compared to what many others have gone through.
I've come to believe that it's not the only purpose of a dream, to be true.
His best purpose is to get us in touch with us where dreams come from, where our passion and happiness came from.
Even a broken dream can fulfill that purpose.
Because of books, I'm here today, happy, again with a purpose in life and with clear view, most of the time over time.
People are always supposed to be books with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came to the class, and she was so amazing, as new girls seem to be always.
She had long hair and a little cute little typewicks, and she was good at geography and her book.
I ran a pubble in this high school, and I ran a frantry until I had a high-maret plan.
So I stayed in school a little bit longer a day, much longer, and I kept in the cafeteria with the girls.
When the air was in, I came out, I stood in the classroom and I took the manual's book.
And then I did it.
I used the grades of my Rivalin, just something, just a few more people.
A bust.
When I wanted to go back the book, I noticed that some of my other classmates also had pretty good grades.
So I reacted in the eifler's heat to all the notes, completely without fantasy.
I gave myself all the four and myself a half-a-a-half, because I was also there all the time.
I'm still hypotherting about my behavior.
I don't understand where this thought came from.
I don't understand why I felt so well at this.
I felt really good.
I don't understand why I was never punished for it.
It was so obvious.
I was never caught.
But most of my amazement is, why was it so much to me that this little girl was so good at the book?
Eifers am shaking me.
It's so mysterious, so profound.
We know that babies suffer under eggs.
Like primates. Shearsters are very vulnerable to nature.
We know that eifers are the main cause of murder among adulterers in the United States.
But I never read a study that could explain to me their loneliness, their longevity, or their macro-connected nerves.
And so we have to approach the literature, because the novel is the lab, where the eggs were analyzed in all of their possible forms.
Is it a exaggeration to say that if we didn't have anesthet, we wouldn't have literature?
So not an impostue studio, not "Odys Sea."
No more polite king, no "Cefesty of 1001 Night."
No Shakespeare.
And that's when the readingers of the U.S. schools come in because we lose, "Shall and Knass," the big "Gatsby," "Madame Bovary," "Anna Karenina."
No eggs, no celebrity. I know that it's been in fashion to say that comets have the answer to everything, but in acreo Eifers, he really has that.
This year, we celebrate the 200th. Jubil's masterpiece on "The Reach for the lost time," and his thoroughly thorough analysis of sexual heat and the normal trade, my thing, that we can have hope.
So do we think about Proust, think about emotions. Right?
We think about the little boys trying to sleep.
We think of cake, put in Lavendel's box.
We forget how rough his vision was.
We forget how it is unconditional.
These are books for Virginia Woolf, like a kitchet.
I don't know what a cativater is, but we say it's powerful.
Let's see why the novel and the eifers who fit up well and practice in such a good way.
Is it obvious that eifers are reduced to person -- desires -- barrier, such a strong basis for a story?
I don't know. I think it's just hard at the painline, because think about what happens when we're more gentle.
When we're more gentle, we tell a story.
And we're telling ourselves stories about the lives of other people and making them feel bad, because they're designed to make us feel bad.
As a narrator of the story, and the audience, we know what details it has to be put in order to break the knife into the rib. Right?
Eifers Breates makes us all amateur novels, and so they knew that they were prehistoric.
The first band, "In Swanns World," in the novel, Swann, one of the protagonists, it's very loving about his loved ones, and how great she's in bed, and suddenly, over the course of several sentences -- so, the vague words, they're like the rivers -- and he's going to realize, "Let's see what I love about this woman.
All they give me, and what excites me, could also help someone else enjoy others, maybe even at that moment."
This is the story he tells us, and from there, Swann wrote a new story that he discovered in his lovedings, lies on his community's committee in his private backyard.
We have to admit that Swann and Proust are notoriously jealous.
Prousty friends would have left the country if they wanted to end with him.
You don't have to be more gentle to clean up that it's hard work. Right?
He's a cure. He's a wasteful.
It's a hungry feeling that needs to be supplied.
What does the eggs like?
Such auster might like information.
Eifers might be able to see detail.
Eifers might enjoy long-grained hair and little cute spicecagneys.
Eifers like photographs.
That's why instagram is also so successful.
Basically, comets are connecting the language of science and the path of the weather.
When the rabifians experience this masqual, suddenly they're on the door, and the servant of their loved ones, he's defending that behavior.
He says, "You might think that's the wrong thing, but it's not something else to interpret or interpret any kind of a stereotypical text or look at a way of thinking."
He says, "There's a scientific study with real intellectual value."
Prousty tries to show us that ecstasal is safe and makes us look silly, but in their core, it's a search for knowledge, for the truth, the painful truth, and what's the seriousness of that is, the more painful the more difficult the more.
Thurs, perse, loss -- that's for the revimination of wisdom.
He says, "A woman we need to suffer us, enlest us a larger and wider spectrum of emotions than a man who interest us."
Does he tell us, for example, that we should look for cruel women?
No. I think he tries to tell us that proposeers tell us something about ourselves.
Is there another emotion that opens up us in this particular way?
Does any other sense that we feel like aggression, our hidden ambition and our desire?
Teachers are going to look at any other feeling with these strange intensity?
Freud should write about it later.
One day, Freud was being harassed by a very young man who was hurt by thought that his wife was cheating.
And Freud says, this man is kind of weird because he doesn't even look at what his wife is doing.
Because she's innocent, and everyone knows that.
The poor creature is clearly under-expecting.
Instead, he looks at things that his wife does without realizing, is doing unreliable behavior.
She or she smiles too much, or she randomly smash with a man?
<unk>amp;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot;quot; says that the man will become the hip of the stranger's seat of his wife's confidence.
The novel is very good at this point.
The novel describes very well, very well, very well, very often in terms of eifers who are trained to look at us, but not looking at us.
Because the more weaker are, the more we are going to get ourselves to performances.
So I think that Eifers will not get us to do the violent or illegal things.
The eggs are really making us more sophisticated.
And I think about it at the age of age, but I also think about the story I've heard on the news.
A five-year-old woman from Michigan was arrested because she was born from a self-built false Facebook account for a year, and she had written nasty messages on herself.
For a year, for a whole time.
She tried to put on her new friend of ex-boyfriend in her shoes, and I would admit when I heard that, I responded to wonder.
Because -- let's be honest.
What kind of huge, even though de-paid, creativity, right?
This is from a novel.
This is from a novel from Patricia Highneith.
High-tith is one of my favorite writers.
She's the most brilliant and weird woman in American literature.
From her, "The Lice In the train," and "The talented Mr. Ripley," all the books that are about it -- like Eifersure, they confused our minds, and we're in the sphere, in this realm of greets, in which the membrane is between, and what might be -- can be dragged through a moment.
Take Tom Ripley, her most famous figure.
First, Tom Rragy wants to be you and have what you have, and he's got you and you've got what you once, and you've gone like the ground. He responds to your name, he's wearing your jewelry, he's carrying your bank account.
That's a method.
But what are we to do? We can't do it like Tom Ripley.
I can't give the world four, even if I'd like to do it in some days.
It's a shame, because we live in a more elentous time.
We live in a "eifer-ereated" time.
We're all good citizens of social media, where the currency is neid. Right?
Does the novel get us out? I'm not sure.
If we do what characters do, if they're not sure they're in the possession of a puzzle.
Let's go to 221 Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
Think about the people at Holmes, think of his Nemesis as a professor Moriarty, this ingenious criminal.
But I always liked <unk>In Interspector<unk> Lest Trade, the head of the Scotland Yard with a rat, the Holmes, the Holm genius, needs the Holm genius, but it exaggerates it.
I'm so familiar with that.
So, race needs its help, it's fine-paying it, and it's kind of retaining the stories over the course of the story.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and eventually comes into "The Six napoleons" as a Hololees, and all of them are amazed by their solution, and they're going to be on the cruise for the Holm and they're like, "We're not New Yorker-friendly to you, Mr.R.
We're proud of you."
And he adds that there wouldn't be any at the Washington Corard, the Sherlock Holmes didn't want to shake their hand.
This is one of the few times that we see Holmes moving into its stories, and I find this little scene very moving, but also mysterious. Right?
It seems like anesthalism doesn't seem to be emotional, it's a physical problem.
At a moment, Holmes is on a different wavelength like transportation.
And the next moment, they're on a wavelength.
Suddenly, it's pushing up the urge to admire this genius that he used to prosecute him before.
Because is it really so easy?
What if acalousy were really just a physical problem? If it were just how we interacted with the other in relation to "to-face?"
Maybe we wouldn't treat somebody else's disease.
We could organize ourselves together.
But I like emergency plans.
As we wait for it, we still have the literature as comfort.
Literists alone flew the eggs.
Literature alone can mourp it, put it in, highlight it.
And who's all of this stuff is, the good business of transport, the terrifying Tom Ripley, the crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
We're in excellent societies.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and on a camp trip with my father at the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area in the northern state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest was cooking.
The sun was letting the leaves look like blowing glass, and if there were no path, you would have almost thought we were the first people to go through this forest.
We got to our tent. We got to our tent.
I saw the little hut on a cliff and looked over a crystalline shell, beautiful lake when something horrible fell up to me.
Behind the roof, there was a garbage cliff, maybe four square meters, with apple pillars, combined with aluminum capture and an old skier.
I was amazed, I was angry and confused.
The bands were too lazy to get away what they were bringing -- who thought they were going to hang on their hands after them?
And I stayed with the question, and I generalized it.
Who is going to come to us?
How do you turn it or where the jellyfish may be, who is behind us in Istanbul?
Who is going to come out of Rio? Is it in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the city hospitalization is about 11,000 tons of waste every day and 2,000 tons of recycled titching.
I wanted to meet them -- as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does the job.
How about wearing a uniform and wearing that kind of service?
So I started a research project with them.
I drove the truck and I drove off the railroad doors and I interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city. I learned a lot, but I was still a foreign minister.
I had to go deeper than that.
So I took a job as a clean skill.
I just drove the truck. I drove the truck.
And I used the mechanical tags and I put the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an exciting experience.
Everybody asks for the smell.
It's there, but it's not the way you think, and in days, it's really bad, you're used to pretty quickly.
You're just used to the weight, you're used to it.
I know people who did this job for several years, and the more common body still adjusted to the weight they're carrying their body, tons of waste every week.
And then there's danger.
After statistics of the Ministry of Trade, the job is in the stadium, under the 10 biggest jobs in the country, and I learned why.
You're on traffic all day, all the time, all the way down.
Everybody wants to stay over and often don't want the car drivers to fit enough.
That's really bad for the workers.
And the waste itself is filled with toxins that fall off the garbage cart and evoke terrible clouds.
I also learned about the unenquency of the trash.
When you come from the board and you see a city in the back of the trash car, you realize that garbage is like a natural force itself.
He doesn't stop coming, he stops coming.
It's also like a breathing or circulating.
He's got to be in motion.
And there's the stigma.
You put the uniform up and you become invisible until someone else -- whatever reason -- because you're blocking the traffic with your car or you're going to drink a break close to your home or drink a coffee in your local local local local and you're going to kill and say they don't want you to go near it.
I find this stigma especially because I firmly believe that the audience of the city hospitality are the most important labor in the streets of the city. That has three reasons.
They are the heads of public health.
If they didn't remove the waste, every day efficiency and effective, it would threaten us from the breastfeeding and the danger of those things, in a very franty way.
So, diseases that we've had for decades and centuries have been under control, would spread and hurt ourselves.
The economy needs it.
If we can't throw the old stuff out, we don't have a place for the new. The motors of the economy start to deteriorate when the consumer is bombed.
I didn't answer capitalism, I only respond to change the interaction.
And then, here's what I call our average, common speed.
And I mean, just how quickly we're used to movement today.
We don't care about repairing our coffee cups or our bag or our water bottle or to store or to navigate.
We take them, throw them away, forget about it, because we know there are people on the other side who care about it.
So today I want to propose some ways to think about urbanity, to improve the stigma and bring it into that conversation, how to create a city that is sustainable and human.
Your work, I think, is kind of a battered.
You see the roads every day, regularly.
They carry uniforms in many cities.
You know when you can expect it.
And their work is what makes us do our work.
They're like a reticination.
The process that they sustain perpetrators makes us safe in front of ourselves, in front of us, of our rejections, and the endurance and this process has to be perpetual to keep the price at all.
In the days of September 11, 2001, I heard the Thurs of a car on the street, and I took my little son and ran down the stairs and there was a man who drove his paper-tuclear transport route to the road, and he's going to do it every other day.
And I tried to thank him for his work -- that day every day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he just looked up and said, "Everything will be good."
"Everything will be good."
It was only later that I started my research on urban admissions and I brought the man back.
His name is Paulie, and we've been working together a lot of times, and eventually we've become good friends.
I wanted to believe that Paulie was right.
All right, it gets good.
But in our efforts to change the way that we exist on this planet as a species, we also have to pay attention to all the costs, including the very human cost of work.
And we'd have to be informed to reach the people who are doing this work, collect their experiences, how we think about systems for sustainability, to solve the roads of road-based recycling, which is a remarkable success of the last 40 years, about the United States of America and the countries, and to bring us a horizon on the other species that we can take away from industrial waste and production.
So, urban waste, what we think about when we talk about waste, is three percent of the national waste waste.
It's a remarkable statistic.
In your life, in your life, if you see someone next time, their job is to clean you down, take a moment to perceive them.
Take a moment to thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
My name is Mayso Zayid, and I'm not drunk, but I'm already the doctor at birth.
He cut my mother six times six different directions and put me in the air in a row and put them down.
And that's why I have infantically cerebral pals, which means I'm going to blow all the time.
Let's take a look.
It's hard. I'm a cross of Shakira, Shakira and Muhammad Ali.
Poor pals are not genetically genetic.
It's not a birth defect. You can't get it.
No one has the uterus of my mother was devastating, and I didn't get it because my parents are the first degree of what they are.
You only get them through accidents like the one that happened on my birth day.
I have to warn you. I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want anyone here to feel pity, because you all have to have a point in your life already from being relieved.
Come on, go ahead.
It's just a quick time in the mall. Your circles turn to a parking lot, and what do you see?
Fourteen empty appliances.
And you're thinking, "Why can't I be a little disabled?"
I've got to tell you, I've got 99 problems and cerebral palsmicies, and it's only one of them.
If there was a Olympic director of oppression, I would find a gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, female, disabled, and I live in New Jersey.
Now, if you don't feel better, I don't know.
Cliff Ide Park in New Jersey is my hometown.
I love the fact that my interruptions and my place have the same initial jobs.
And I love the fact that I could walk from my house to New York City if I wanted.
A lot of people don't walk with Ph.S., but my parents didn't believe in a "colol."
The mantra of my father was, "Yes, you can do that! You can."
So when my three sisters were numb, I mixed with them.
When my three older sisters went to a public school, my parents gave the school system so I could go, and if we didn't all get a sick, we all had the pantot over my mother's matriple.
My father brought me running when I was five by putting my heel on his feet and just walking around.
Another one of his tactics was to let a dollar drone sniff in front of my nose so I can start.
My inner stymers were very strong, and when -- yes. So, on the first day in kindergarten, I was walking like a champion who had gotten you too far.
There were only six Arabs in my city, and all of them were my family.
Today, we have 20 Arabs in the city, and they're still all my family.
I don't think any people have noticed that we're not Italian.
That was before 9<unk>11, and before the politicians thought it was, "I hate Muslims" as a campaign engine.
The people I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
But they were really concerned that I might be able to starf up to Ramadan.
And I explained to them that I could live on my body three months, so it was packaged from sunrise to the turn -- and it was a car game.
I've traded on Broadway.
Yes, on Broadway. Total Takes mad.
My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned how to dance on discomfort, so I can walk on discomfort.
And I'm from Jersey, where it's really important to be chic, so when my friends wearing orders of poetry, I'm also going to be there.
And if my friends spent their summer villages on the coast of the coast of the Jersey, I didn't.
I spent my summer in a war zone because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back every single summer to Palestine, we're going to be like Madonna.
The summer worker often passed me to cure me, so I drank milk of deer's milk, was burned in the dead sea, and I know how the water burned in the eye, and I thought, "It works! It works!"
But a miracle generation we found: I mean, yoga.
I have to say it's really boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't even stand.
I can also stand on my head.
My parents always feel like I was able to do anything that wasn't a dream, and my dream was to play with the soap opera, "The Growth Hospital."
And because of the investment of the minority, I got a great scholarship at the ASU, the Arizona State University, because I handed every minority.
I was sort of the housework of acting training.
Everybody loved me.
I measured all the homework that I'm doing not so clever kids, I got all my classes, and I got them all over their classes.
Every time I played a scene from "The Glasmenagerie," my teachers would handnate me.
But I never got a role.
In my graduate year, the ASU has finally taken a piece called "She's dancing in Jackson."
A piece about a girl with the C.
I was a girl with Ph.
So I ran all over the place, and I said, "Oh, I get a role!
I have cerebral palship!
Finally, free! Finally!
Thank you, I'm finally free!"
I didn't get the role.
Sherry Brown got the role.
I put on the head of acting training, I cried hysterically, as if someone shot my cat and asked her why. She told me that I would not get the stunts.
I said, "Sorry, but if I can't afford the stunts, the character can't do it either."
I was born for that role, and they gave them a actor without the C.
The university was revating life.
Hollywood is eagerly known for making physical actors play a healthy actor.
After graduating, I moved home. My first role was an statisticin in a soap worker.
My dream was changed.
And I knew I was going to go from "The lunch food," and I knew I was going to go up to "the lunch mat."
But instead, I was left with a glamorized furniture that was only recognizable in the back of my head, and I realized that Casting's not making a bluffed, ethnic, disabled actor.
They just asked perfect people.
But there are exceptions that confirm the rule.
I grew up with Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr and Ellen, and all these women had a common one: They were a cometic.
So I became a comicin.
My first job was to drive famous cometic committees from New York City to Shows in New Jersey and I will never ever forget the face of the first comier I ever drove when he realized that on the street, on the street, he was riding on a banjo with a banjo.
I've come to the U.S. and I've also made shows in the Middle East in Arabic, unented and unaffected and unraveled.
Some people say I'm the first cometic in the Arab world.
I don't like to call myself the first but I know they've never heard of the bad little cheeries that women aren't funny, and they seem like us.
In 2003, my brother began by another mother and father, Dean Obeidallah, and I started with the New York American Comedy Festival, which is now running his 10-year-old.
Our goal was to change the negative image of American Arab states in the media, and at the same time, Casting Casting Media colleagues in thinking that South Asia and Arabia are not synonymous.
The same theme of Arabs was much more easy than the challenge to tackle the stigma of disability.
My big breakthrough was in 2010.
I was invited to the news show at the International Atstdown with Keith Olbermann.
I got dressed in like the high schoolball, I moved into a studio, and I sat down on a roll-and-wire chair.
So I looked at the stage managers and I said, "Sorry, can I get another chair?"
And she looked at me and she said, "Foo, four, three, two ..."
And we were live!
So I had to hold my mind on the table of the host so that I didn't roll out of the screen during the screen, and when the interview was over, I was just outside myself.
There was my chance, and I had failed her, and I knew that you never invite me.
But Mr. Olbermann invited me not only one again, but he brought me to a full-time worker and stuck my chair.
With the work of Keith Olbermann, I learned something new: all people on the Internet are three dicks.
People say children are cruel, but as a child or a grown, someone has never done fun with me.
In the World Wide Web, I'm in freewild with my disability all of a sudden.
When I look at online videos, I see comments like, "Eyy, why do you put that?"
"Ey, is that smiled?"
And my favorite is, "Armer Henngel Slististist.
Have they been hungry?
We should pray for them."
And in fact, I was suggesting that I would actually record my disability in the titchbacks: scriptwrite, cometic, cerebral palsmic.
A disability is as visible as the origin.
If a wheelchair driver can't play Beyonc<unk>, can't play a wheelchair driver either.
The disabled are the biggest -- yes. That's worth applause. Go.
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresentative in the entertainment industry.
The doctors said I could never walk, but I'm sitting here in front of you.
But if I was raised with social media, maybe I wouldn't be here.
And I hope that together we can create a positive image of disability in the media and in the everyday life.
Maybe there's less hatred on the Internet if there were more positive role models.
Or maybe not.
Maybe it takes a village to teach a child how well it is to raise a child.
With my journey with me, I moved to a few very special places.
I was allowed to run on the red carpet next to the soap lobby, Susan Lucci and the ikonque Lorraine Arbus.
I was allowed to play with Adam Sandler and work with my gentleman, who's wonderful Dave Matthews.
I'm a major character with the comedy studio "Arabs Gone Wild Wild Wild."
I was representative of the great state of New Jersey New Jersey in the National Committee of 2008.
I founded "Americanso's Children" a charity who tries to give Palestinian refugee children the fraction of a chance that my parents gave me.
But the moment that most outweighs -- before this -- the moment that I've come out most was when I was standing in front of the man who flies like a butterfly and he's crawling like a bee that's Parkinson's disease and just sort of ziff like me. I'm Muhammad.
This was the only time my father ever saw a live-life move from me, and I devised this talk to him.
: May God bless your soul, Dad, Dad. My name is Maysoquay Zayid, "If I can, you can too."
There was a time when we solved big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of the moonland of Apollo 11 and went down to the sea of calm.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their present view on the gray moon was the peak of a persistent, communal endeavor.
The Apollo program was the largest peace mobilization in the history of the United States.
To get to the moon, NASA invested about 180 billion dollars according to the current value of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo created jobs for 400,000 people, and they required the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and authorities.
People died, including the release of Apollo 1.
But by the end of the Apollo program, 24 people flew to the moon.
From the 12 who passed his surface, Aldrin, after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest.
But why did they go?
They didn't bring back much, they brought home three hundred pounds of old rocks, and something that everyone else in 24 months later -- a new sense of the fact that our common home is small and fragile.
Why did they go? Zynynly went to see her because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
But Kennedys's words from 1962 at Rice University give a better clue.
For the time, Apollo was not just a victory of the West over the east during the Cold War.
At that time, the strongest feeling of amazingness was the sheer nature of technology.
They flew to the moon because it was a little big.
The Mola country happened in front of a series of new technological trumpets.
From the first half of the 20th century, the assembly line and the airplane, penicillin and a vaccine against tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, polio and smallpox were eradicated.
Technology seemed to have something to have been called Alvin Toffler in 1970 called a "bave acceleration."
For most of the human history, we couldn't move faster than a horse or a boat with sails, but in 1969, the Renaissance of Apollo 10 to 10 kilometers per hour was killed by the speed of about 40 cents per hour.
Since 1970, no human beings have been more than the moon.
No one has ever moved faster than the release of Apollo 10, and the unscathed optimism about the power of technology, because the big problems we had had to solve with technology have allowed us to fly to Mars, for example, to clean energy, to cure cancer or to liberate the world from hunger, seem to seem to be difficultly unable to fix it.
I remember five years old, I remember.
The Apollo 17th, and my mother had been reminded that they didn't look too much at the feathery slope of Saturn's pack.
I had a clue that this would be the last moon award, but I was 100 percent sure that there would be another population on Mars in my life.
The treaty was, something happened to our ability to solve big problems with technology, has become a flat-time place.
You hear it everywhere.
We heard it here in the last two days at TED.
It's a question that we'd have had technologists distracted ourselves and self-contite with the appropriate toys, with things like iPhones and apps and social media, or algorithms that accelerate automated business.
It's not right with most of these things.
They've cleaned up our lives and they've enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of human rights.
What happened?
There's a slow explanation from Silicon Valley where you admit that recently, less ambitious companies have been funded than in the years that Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Gene Tech have been funded.
In Silicon Valley, they say the markets were guilty, in the large ranks, the premium numbers that the risk investors are offering to the companies.
Silicon Valley says that risk investors have moved away from supporting world-changing ideas, and instead growing problems, or even revolution problems.
But that explanation is not good enough to me.
It's basically explaining what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
Even in their risk-related times, low-income investors moved small facilities in advance. low-income investments with a fee-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-off-tested investment.
Investors have always struggled to invest in providing energy in technologies like energy that require a huge self-interest and development and long-term and time-lasting, and risk investors never funded the development of technologies that resolve big problems without any private value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve a big problem are more complicated and more profound.
Sometimes we're not realizing to fix the big problems.
We could fly to Mars if we want to.
NASA has even designed a plan before.
But going to Mars would be a political choice for public popularity, and therefore it will never happen.
We're not going to fly to Mars because everyone thinks there are more important things on Earth that need to be done.
Another time, we can't solve the big problems because our political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the energy use on the planet are more advanced, renewables, like solar and biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason for that is sustainable.
Now, coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and oil than biofuels.
We all want alternative sources of energy that can be able to compete, but there are no such thing.
Now, it's the idea that engineers, business leaders and economics are basically all of the same minds that are driving national practices and international development to develop alternative energy: mainly a significant increase in research and development and development and development technologies and increased carbon costs.
But in the current political climate, there is no hope that the energy policies of the United States or the international treaty are going to take those opinions and restore them.
Sometimes deep problems that have been technically solvable, but not that.
It's been believed for a long time that famines are in the failure of food supply.
But 30 years of research has taught us that hunger is political crisis, which have catastrophic impact on food distribution.
Technology can improve things like breeding protocols or systems like warehouse and transportation, but there will be hunger until there's no shortage of governance.
And in the end, sometimes the big problems are drawn down, because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon in 1971 declared the war, but soon it was found that there are many species of cancer, most of which are resilient against therapy, and only last 10 years, seem to be effective, realistic therapies.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems with technology.
We can, we have to, but we have to be able to be able to have these four elements of people, reward leaders and public leaders, to be interested in solving a problem, to support institutions to solve the solution; it has to be really a technological problem; and we have to understand it.
Apollomary Finance, which became a kind of metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, filled with these criteria.
But this is a model that can't be repeated in the future.
It's not the year of 1961.
There's no dramatic combat like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy, who's doing all the hard and dangerous to a heroism, and no popular science fiction, my mythology, like exploring the solar system.
But most of the people who are in the end, it was easy to fly to the moon.
He was just three days away.
And it's fair whether this has really solved a serious problem.
We've been on our own, and the solutions of the future are going to be more difficult to do.
God knows, we don't have any challenges at all.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
So, in front of you, you're standing in front of your door.
If you look at the door, their color and the material that it's made of.
Now, you're going to have a group of overweight FKKers on their bicycles.
It's a blank bicycle race, and they come right on top of you and your doorstep.
You really have to imagine that.
They're going to clinging, sweat and jump right up to you.
And then they all pinch right into their own backyard.
You have bicycles, wheels, everything flies around and around. You can't see if you're in a womb.
Now, you go through the threshold of your apartment, your flop or whatever is on the other side of your apartment, and enjoy how the light is breaking in the room.
The light seems to be on the crisquade.
You can get out of the back of a yellow-brain horse.
A fateful horse.
You can almost feel how his blue nose is ticking your nose.
You rubble the chocolate toys that are drifting into your mouth.
Go past him, go past him, in your living room.
Here you are with all your imagination at Britishney Spears.
Their clothes only cover the vest, singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time," as she dance on your living roomroom.
Now, in your kitchen, I follow you.
The ground was replaced by a yellow Band-Aid truck, and from your oven you come to Dorothy, the Zinnman, the Buchu, the king of the Magic of Oz, in hand, they hop on you.
Okay. Now open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a very bizarre competition that is held in New York City every year.
It's called "Our Amazon Memory Championship."
A few years ago, I wanted to be talking about this competition as a science journalist, and I expected to find the anniversary of the island Department of Science.
It was a bunch of guys, and a few ladies, from very different age and hygienic levels.
They once again looked at hundreds of random numbers.
Learning to read the names of dozens and dozens of unknowns.
And I realized that all the poetry stories were all over the minutes.
They traded on the basis of who could consider the order of a mixed maps that were the fastest.
That's crazy.
These people have to have supernatural skills.
I started talking to some of them.
This is Ed Cook, a guy who came from England and has one of the best-tuned experiences there.
And I asked him, "Well, when did you notice you've got this special desire?"
And Ed said, "I'm not an island exhibition.
I only have an average memory.
Anyone who's here is going to tell you that he or she's got a standard memory.
We've all been working on using ancient techniques, trained to perform these incredible memory works, techniques that invented the Greeks two years ago, the same techniques that Cicero used to memorize his speeches and use their peers to memorize all the medieval scholars to memorize all the books."
And I just thought, "Wow, how come I've never heard of it?"
We were outside of the competition room and Ed, this wonderful, brilliant, and something an ultra-centric English guy says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.
Kennhe Britney Spears?"
I said, "What? How? Why?"
I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a mixed maps. The U.S. TV.
It would prove that this can all be shown in the world."
I told him, "I'm not British Spears, but you could teach me.
I mean, you have to start somewhere, right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
A lot of the next year, I was not only going to spend my memory training, but also to study it and understand how it works, why it sometimes can't work and what its potential could be.
I've met a lot of really interesting people.
For example, this is E.P.
He's suffering from memory and probably having the worst memory in the world.
His memory is so bad that he doesn't even remember his memory problem, which is amazing.
Although it was so tragic, he offered a glimpse of how much memory our memory makes us who we are.
And on the other side of the spectrum, I learned how to do that.
Kim Peek knows.
He was the ancestor of Dustin Hoffmans's character in the movie "Rain Man."
We spent a afternoon learning books in the public accounting books in Salt Lake City, just fascinating.
And I came back to read a whole stack of paper papers about memory, stays, which were written over two and more often in Latin, and later in middle-class classes.
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting things.
And what was fascinating to me was that there was a time to learn how to train memory, to cultivate, to cultivate, not to be as alien as I've been today.
There was a time when people invested in their memory, and they were playing it,
Over the last few millennia, we've invented a number of technologies -- from the alphabet to type of type, to the Codex, the book plate, the computer, the smartphone, the smartphone, which made it easier for us to adjust our memory to the external ability to actually apply that human ability.
These technologies have enabled our modern world, but at the same time, our world has changed.
They've changed us in a cultural way, and I would argue that they've changed us also with cognitive abilities.
Without remembering the need, it seems sometimes as if we'd forgotten how to do that.
One of the last places on Earth, where you can still find people who are still passionate about training their memory, disciplined and cultivate, is this unique memory competition.
In fact, it's not as unique, there's competition as this one in the world.
And that's what's been drawn into the bann, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group at the University College London brought a group of memory actors to the lab.
You wanted to know, is the structure or anatomy of your brains unlike the rest of us?
The answer was no.
Are we smarter than us?
They gave them a set of cognitive tests, and the answer was not actually.
However, there was an interesting and much of the signifle difference between the brain of a memory singer and the control person compared to it.
If you put it in a fMRI machine and you scan your brain while you're going to look at numbers and images of snowflakes, you can see that in the memory of other regions of the brain, unlike the rest of us.
It seems like they're using the part of their memory, which is used for the spatial and navigation of the space.
Why? And can we learn something about it?
The race to the best mind is dominated by a kind of race that any one would have to deal with a new technology that is rapidly more than more evidence, and to get the rest of the field.
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-step world-class memory champions.
On the table before him, 36 pieces of cards he put in the deck of cards, and within an hour of technology he invented and used to be a single-foundist.
He used a similar technique to consider the order of four to cover 140 random medals in half an hour.
Yes.
And even though there's a vast amount of techniques to accommodate various things in this competition, all of these techniques are based on the concept that psychologists call "entit collaborative practices."
This is what's called the baker baker bubble bubble, which is specifically illustrating this concept, which is like, if I ask two people to remember the same word, and I'll tell you, "Look, there's a person called the baker."
That's his name.
And I'll tell you, "Look, there's a person who's a baker."
Now, if I come back to you a little bit later and say, "You know the word I told you a few years ago?
Do you know what word it was?"
The person who should remember the person called the baker reminds himself of the less probability of the word than the person who should remember the man who was going to be with the baker.
The same word, different memory abilities, that's odd.
What's going on here?
Well, the name of baker means nothing to you.
It's completely independent of all the memory experiences that are blurching around your head.
But the shop profession, we know baker.
Baker, you're wearing some weird white shirts.
Boomers have a muscle in their hands.
Banks smell well when they come home from work.
We might even know a baker.
And when we hear the word first, we connect these associations with the word and allow the word to find the memory gradually again.
The secret to what goes on in memory combat and the secret to understanding everyday things is to find a way to transform the brand in the profession -- a information that has not connected to association, not meaning, in a way, in a way, to change meaning, in a way that makes sense that it feel better, and it has to make sense of connection with everybody else's minds.
One of the most sophisticated techniques for this can be re-engineering back two and a half years on ancient Greeks.
She was known as the memory palace.
The story of its creation is how follows: There was a poet named Simonides who visited a feot.
He was in charge of the conversation, because then, when you wanted to put a really big party, you didn't hire a D.J., but a poet.
He's wearing his poem from memory and leaving the room. And right now, the hallw behind him collapsed and performing all the guests.
Not only are all dead, their bodies are excluded to the defensibility.
No one can tell who was there, no one knows where to care.
The body cannot be properly bribed.
It's a tragedy after the other.
Simon's out there, the only surviving survival of this disaster, and he's putting his eyes in, and he's suddenly contemplating that he can see in front of his inner eye, which is the guest.
And so he picks the disabled in the hand, and he leads through the rubble to the deceased.
And in this moment, Simon Simon's understood something that we all intuitively know already, that we can't understand the names we both recognize, phone numbers, or literal instructions of our colleagues, we have a very good visual and spatial memory.
If I asked you to repeat the first 10 words of history about Simonides, you would find it difficult.
But I bet if I were to ask you to remember who's sitting on a speaking black horse in your foyer, you might be able to visualize that.
The idea of memory is to build a building in the inner eye and fill it with images of removing things -- the more craving, awkward, delicious, dirty, weak, light-taking image, so it burns so much in memory.
This is a advice that goes back on the over 6,000-year-old Latin language text across memory.
So how does it work?
So if you're invited to give a talk here at TED, and you want to give it out of your memory, just like Cicero, he would have been invited to TEDxRome 2,500 years ago.
You could do this. You're going to get a seat in front of your door.
You have a perfectly crazy story, and you have a terrible story with no uncertain images to remind you that you're going to start talking about this crazy competition.
And then you go into your house and you see the crucible on the back of Mr. Ed.
And that would remind you to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then when you see Britney Spears, you remember a funny anecdote you wanted to talk to.
You go to your kitchen, and the fourth thing you wanted to talk about was this weird journey you've gone to for a year, and you have some friends helping you remember it.
So they found out that they had a cultured speaker -- not words for word, but it was just confused but it was about issues.
The English word "topic" is a subject of word-driven phrase, comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "the site."
These are remains of the times people thought about immemritions and rhetoric in spatial terms.
The informal "Evidence" is really, first place in your memory.
I just found all this just fascinating and still still.
I'd like to give you some memory fights.
I might like to write a little bit about this sub-culture of well-being.
But there was a problem.
The problem is that memory laughter are dead-day-day-day experiences.
It's like a group of people sitting there and writing a test.
It's quite exciting when someone stops the bat.
I'm a journalist, I need something that's worth writing for you.
I know that the most amazing things happen in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to it.
So if I wanted to tell this story, I had to put myself in place.
And so I started, every morning 15 to 20 minutes before I sat down with my newspaper, I began to memorize anyone.
Maybe a poem or a poem.
A paper that I bought on the flaw market from an old year.
I had to find out that it's amazing a lot of fun.
I never could imagine that.
It's been done because it's not about training memory.
You want to be better and better at keeping up with that crazy, colorful, dirty, fun, fun, and hopefully to be able to dream images in front of your inner eye.
I turned it into it.
I'm here with my standard memory competition competition.
A couple of e-bistists and a shelter that has been covered until two little stripes, because distractions are the largest enemy of memory combat.
I went to the same competition I had visited a year earlier.
And I was so afraid to participate in this, just as a journalian experiment.
It could be a nice epilog for my research.
The problem was that this experiment wasn't how planned.
I won the competition, which is not supposed to have happened.
It was nice to be able to speak out and talk to phone numbers and shopping lists, but that wasn't what I wanted to get.
These are just tricks.
Now, tricks work because they build ideas about how our brain works.
You don't have to build a memory palms or you have to interfere with your maps so that you can benefit from the way you're going to get your memory.
We talk about people with good memory as if they're a special desire, but that's not true.
Good laughs are trained.
We're better at finding things better when we pay attention.
We remember when we're engaged.
We remember, if we have the opportunity to figure out why information and experiences are meaningful for us, why they have meaning and they come from, if we can convert it into something that makes sense to us differently in our other memory, if we can turn the name "bub" into the job.
The memory, the memory process, the memory techniques, they're all shortcuts.
In fact, it's not even really shortcutting.
They work because they force us to work.
They're forcing us to process and be alert, in a way that we don't usually be.
But it's not shortcutting.
That's how things are stuck in memory.
One of the things I want to give you on the way, something I learned through E.P., the man who didn't even remember his memory problem, and our lives are the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose ourselves from our little lives anyway, that we're constantly looking at our Blackberry or our iPhone, instead of looking at us with the people who are talking to us, paying attention to us? How much are we ready to lose because we're so lazy that we don't want to process and remember them deeply?
I've learned that memory, in each of us, has incredible capacity.
If we want to live a life of adventure, we have to be the person who doesn't forget to remember it.
Thank you.
At the age of 27, I left a hard job in the corporate company campaigning for a more challenging task: Teaching.
I was teaching math for you guys in New York for seventh grade schools.
Like every teacher, I did tests and exams.
I gave homework homework.
When the work came back, I prepared grades.
And that's not the only difference between the best and worst students.
I<unk>s some of my most powerful students were not radical carbon dioxide.
Some of my smartest kids don't do very well.
That made me think.
What you learn in math in the seventh year is quite difficult: National numbers, deconrillion numbers, the area of a parallelogram.
But it's not possible, these ideas are not. I was firmly convinced that all my students could learn the stuff when they work long and hard enough.
And I came to the conclusion after several years in school that we had a much better understanding of education for students and learning from a perspective of motivation, from a psychological perspective.
What we can measure best in education is I." But what if you go to school and life, more than the ability to learn quickly and easily?
So I left the classroom and I set up a design student to go to psychiatrist.
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of ultra-prep-drating situations, and I always wondered who's successful and why?
My research team and I went to the West Point Militrakan Academy.
We tried to predict which clickets would remain in the troopal care and which ones wouldn't.
We went to the national bookstore and we tried to predict which children would come the most far.
We studied teenagers who worked in very difficult housing and asked what teachers would still teach at the end of the year of the year and what would improve their students' learning practices at the most effective improvement.
We joined partnerships with private companies, and we asked, what are the guys who are keeping their jobs?
and who would make most of the money and who would deserve the most money.
In all these different contexts, there was a property of significance that came out of success.
We didn't have social intelligence.
It wasn't a good look, physical health, and it wasn't I."
It was resilience.
Inability, passion and persistence is for very long-term targets.
Inability, taxity is taxability.
The advantage of the trance is, if you think about a map of the future, not just for a week or a month, but for years, and really work hard to make this plan happen.
In between the power of life, life is like a marathon, not a sprint.
I started teaching in public schools in Chicago in the middle of my care.
I asked thousands of students to fill out on the lower high school post-med notes in the back of the line, and then wait for a year to see who was going to graduate.
It turns out that children with higher performance have been able to graduate, even if I'd devote all the measurable properties, things like family income, results at standardized tests, even how confident they felt in school.
So the advantage of impenches is not just in Westpoint and in the bookwork competition, but in school, especially for children with excess.
The scariest thing about this issue for me is that we know so little that science knows so little about how to build it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we support the relationship between the children?"
How do I teach children a solid work ethic?
How do I keep them ready for distance?"
The honest answer: I don't know.
But what I know is that talent alone doesn't give you any relationship with the inner.
Our data shows that a lot of talented people are simply not going to be true to their dedication.
In fact, the advantage of our knowledge is not generally talented, but it's even correlated with talent.
As far as the best idea I've heard about building resilience is what's called growth-based attitude.
This idea was developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it's been shaped to the belief that the ability to learn is not determined, but that it can change with your use.
Dr. Dweck showed that children, when they read about the brain and learn how it changes as an answer to challenges and growing, failing failure is far more likely because they don't believe failure is a permanent state.
This growth-based posture is a great idea for building resilience.
But we need more.
Here I want to end my remarks, because we're so far.
That's the work that's in front of us.
We need to stop and test our best ideas and most powerful intentions.
We have to measure whether we've succeeded. We have to be willing to fail to fail, to be wrong, to learn lessons and start from scratch.
In other words, we need the resilience to give our children more resilience.
Thank you.
In the center of my work, the connection between over-cognition to our community lives and part of the environment, where architecture is grown from natural, local conditions, and traditions.
I've brought to this today as an example of what I've got, and I've got some current projects.
Both of these projects are in emerging economies, one in Ethiopia and one in Tunisia.
They also have, collectively, that the different analyses of different perspectives will become a much of the supernatural architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a more diverse shopping mall in Ethiopia, Addis Abeba.
This is the kind of building that was shown to us, my team and myself, as an example of what we should design.
I thought I wanted to go shopping first.
So after seeing some of these buildings -- there are many of them in the city -- we realized that they have three key features.
First of all, these buildings are almost empty because they are very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, they need a lot of energy because the surfaces are made of glass, which is what makes heat inside, and then you need a lot of cooling.
In a city where it shouldn't happen, because they have pretty mild weather, which is 20 to 25 degrees every year.
And third, her image has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a tough place with such rich culture and tradition.
And I was also fascinated with the first Ethiopia convention of the old market with this open-up structure where thousands of people go and shop and shop every day with little players.
It also has this idea of public space that uses the outside environment to create activity.
So I thought, this is exactly what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was, how could we design a more recently, contemporary building with these principles?
The next challenge we came to look at the property, because it's in a real growth area of the city, where most of the buildings you see on the screen were not there yet.
And it's also two parallel roads that have no connection over hundreds of meters.
The first thing we did was we created a connection between these two roads, and we put all the input input in the building there.
This continues in a gene at a temperate facility that creates a free air space in the building, protecting itself from its own shape, from the sun and rain.
So to put that space, we place the idea of a market with little stores changing in every floor because of the shape of the emptying space.
I also thought, how do we close the building?
I really wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate systems.
I started thinking about textiles, like a bowl of concrete with perforits that leave the air and the light, but in filtered form.
And then I was inspired by these beautiful buttons on the clothing of Ethiopian women.
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and that helped me create the entire facade.
We build this with these little remote devices, the windows, the air and light, controlled in the building.
And that's being absorbed through these little colored glasses that use the light from the fly-in-minkers to light the building at night.
It wasn't easy to convince the construction managers to do these ideas because they thought, "That's not shopping Mall. We didn't order that. We didn't order that."
But then we've all realized that this idea of the market is much more profitable than the idea of a shopping mall, because they can basically sell more stores.
Also, the idea of the facade was much, much less expensive, not just because of the material, but also because we didn't need air conditioning anymore.
So we created some cost savings that we used to realize what we were doing to do.
The first purpose was to think about how we could make the building energy-efficient, in a city that has almost every day of power.
We created a valuable contribution by setting up solar panels on the roof.
And under this Panel, we started to introduce the roof as a new public space with room spaces and bars that build this urban oasis.
These are the four-fowers on the roof collecting the water to restore the sanitation facilities.
hopefully the next year, because we've already completed the construction to the fifth floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and institutions in Tunis.
To do such a big project, the largest project I'd ever designed, I really had to understand the city of Tunis, but also the environment, the tradition and the culture.
And so while I was doing this analysis, I was particularly focused on the Medina, which is the 1,000-year-old structure that was attached to a wall, accessible by 12 Tore, and was moved almost entirely by lines.
When I went to the property, the first step to extend existing roads to create the first 12 blocks, comparable sizes and properties like the cash in Barcelona and other European cities with these storms.
In addition, we chose some strategic points in court to the idea of these tore and connected them with straight lines, and changed the original pattern.
The last step was to think about the cell, the little cell on the project, like the apartment, was a major part of the master's grandger.
What would be the best alignment in a meditated climate for a apartment?
This is North-fouth because of the temperature parameters between the two home pages that are created and creates a natural repair of air.
So we're putting a pattern on it that makes sure most apartments are perfectly aligned in that direction.
And that's the result, it's almost like a combination of a European blocks and the Arab city.
There are the blocks with the tide and the ground floor, there are all these connections for pedestrians.
It also fits the local rules that are more dense in the upper floor and a lower density of the soil.
It also enhances the concept of the tore.
The volume has these connections that are allowed to self-assemble through three different apartment types, and it also contributes to very dense four-way lights that are moving into the ground. In the internal areas, there are three different institutions, like a score-of-life and a kindergarten, and a number of businesses that are bringing activity into the ground.
The roof, my favorite place on this project, is almost back in the community, which is used to be built by building.
And there, all the neighbors can come up and come together and do things like a two-kilometer walk in the morning, moving from one building to another.
These two examples have a common approach to design.
They're in emerging economies where you can literally grow the cities.
In these cities, the effect of architecture in today and future life in humans today changes local communities and economies as quickly as the buildings grow.
And so, I think it's important that architecture is finding simple, but affordable solutions that reinforces the relationship between community and environment, and that are aimed to connect nature and humans.
Thank you.
I want to talk about trust, and I want to remind you about the common opinions about trust.
They're so ubiquitous that they've become the cliche.
I think there are three of them, I think.
First, trust is very high in decline, many people believe.
And then we have a goal: We should trust more.
And one task is, we should rebuild trust.
I believe that the claim that the target and the task is based on false ideas.
I want to tell you a different story about a claim, a target and a task that offers a much better approach to the cause.
It was the first reason that people think that trust has gone back?
And when I really think about it with my current knowledge, I don't know the answer.
Maybe it took off in some activities or institutions and maybe in others.
I'm missing the implications.
But of course, I can look at the surveys that are supposedly the source for the belief that the trust has gone.
Now, if you look at opinion requests over a period, there's not much evidence for that.
That's how people say that were mistrusted 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still complaining.
And the people who were very familiar about 20 years ago are still becoming very familiar: preacher, nurses.
We're in other countries. By the way, the average citizen is almost exactly in the middle.
But is that a good proof?
Now, opinion questions -- and I'm sure -- opinion is rising.
What else could they go up?
So they look at the general attitude of people when they ask them to do certain questions.
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?
Now, if you asked someone, do you trust me with the veering?
You have to trust fish players?
You have to trust basic teachers?
And you'd probably ask, "What exactly?"
And that would be a reasonable response.
And if you understand the answer, you might say, "I trust some of them, others don't."
It's fine, it's rational.
In short, we try to bring trust in our short lives, in different ways.
We don't think we all rely on every official or constituencies in an official or institutional institution.
So I could say, for example, that I would be familiar with a particular official friend of mine to teach the first class to read, but I wouldn't let them go to the school bus.
I may have heard of it, and I know it's not going to drive well.
I strongly believe that my blaming friend is holding a conversation on the way, but maybe not because they're a secret.
Simple.
So we know from our daily lives about how different trust can look, but why do we find this knowledge in a more abstract way to think about trust?
The surveys here are very bad at preventing the actual trust level, because they ignore the common sense of common sense that you use in trust.
Second, we come to the target.
The goal is to trust more.
I think it's really stupid to say the goal.
I wouldn't be careful that.
I would try to trust the trustworthy more, the trustworthy, but not.
I'm actually actively focused on not trusting trustworthy.
And those who, for example, put their savings in their hands in the hands of a certain Mr. Madoff, who then, like the name, has been able to make the dust, "we" -- "weed," I think, I think, "weh, too much trust.
"Mrepreneurs" isn't a clever target in this life.
To use trust and to refuse the target should be the goal.
And then you say, yes, what's most important is not trust, but trustworthiness.
The trustworth of people can be more vulnerable.
And to do that, we have to look at three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?
If we find a person in the best associated issues, reliable and honest, we have a good reason to trust them, then they are trustworthy.
But if the person is unimportant, probably not.
Some of my friends are competent and honestly, but I wouldn't send them a letter because they are anxious.
I have friends who trust very in their own competence, but they overestimate them by a lot.
And I'm very glad that I don't have a lot of friends who are competent and reliable but are irreversible.
If I didn't realize it, I didn't realize it yet.
But we're looking for this: trustworth, trust, trust.
Trust is the response.
The trustworth are important. That's obviously hard.
Over the last decades, we've been trying to set control systems in all sorts of institutions and experts and courses that make it easier to value their trustworth.
Many of these systems have the advantage of the impact.
They don't work like they're not functioning.
And one middle of the soul once said to me, "The problem is that the paperwork is longer than the baby to bring the world to the world."
All in our public lives, in our institutions, this problem is going to collapse on, and this is a system of trustworth and credibility, but it's going to lead to the contrary.
It distracts people like Hebrew from their difficult tasks by putting them in the kicks.
I'm sure any of these can contribute examples of what I'm sure.
So far as far as you can get there.
The goal is more trustworth, and it's going to be difficult if we want to be trustworthy and communicate with others, and if we want to estimate whether other people, or officials or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. You have to estimate it. Simple reactions or attitudes don't have to go.
And now, to the task.
To describe this as a trust recovery, it's turning back the action.
Because it suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
We can do that, of course, for ourselves.
We can choose a little bit of trustworth.
So two people can improve their trust in a way.
But ultimately, trust is characterized by another that has been given to another.
You can't rebuild what other people give.
You have to give them a base to trust you.
So you have to be trustworthy.
And of course, it's because normally you can't put all the people around you, at the same time.
But you also have to make evidence skills that you're trustworthy.
How do we do that?
This happens every day, everywhere. Normal people do it, officials, friendly, very effective.
Here's a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks, they let me go back and ask them not questions.
They take back and give me the money back, or some of the crayons in which the crayons in which they wish the paint.
That's great. I trust them because they have shown me vulnerable.
There's an important moral in it.
You're going to be vulnerable to the person, and that's a very good indication that you're trustworthy, and that you're distracting your own opinion.
So our goal is basically not very hard to see.
They are relationships between trustworthy people, and in effect of caring for them, when or whether the other is trustworthy.
So the moral of history is to think a lot less about trust, or to think about the attitudes that are correct or misidentified by opinion or in processor, and much more about trustworthiness and how to provide people adequate, useful, useful and simple evidence of trustworthiness.
Thank you.
You know, the best part of the father's father is the movies I can look at.
I love looking at my own favorite films with my kids. When my daughter was four years old, we looked at the magic writers of Oz.
The film did not let them go away months.
Her favorite character, of course, was Glinda.
So she had a good excuse to wear a skinny dress and a magic wand.
But if you look at this film often enough, you can see how extraordinary it is.
We live in the current time today, and we raise our children in a kind of spectacular child-made industrial engineering system.
But "The Magic of Oz" was different.
He didn't start this trend.
It took 40 years to get through this trend, with -- interestingly, another movie where a guy had saved a little dance with a little girl with a lot of her fur by feeling like the veil of enemy.
You know what I'm talking about, right?
Exactly.
Well, there's a big difference between these two films, even a lot of big differences between "The Magic of Oz" and all the movies that we're looking at today.
First of all, there's a lot of violence in "The Magic of Oz" in New Yorker.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, just like the apple trees.
But I think if "The Magic of Oz" were produced today, the magicist would have said, "Dorothy, you're the Rasetterin of Oz, which was once rejuvenated.
Use your magic shoes to defeat the hands of computers, the poor phriles of the West."
But that's not how it happens.
Another point that I find very unique about "The Magic of Oz" is that the heroic and smartest and even the most vulnerable characters are female.
I noticed that the first time I showed my daughter "Star Wars," which was later years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I had a son too.
He was just three years old at the time.
He wasn't invited to that cinema night. He was still too young.
But he was the second child, and he was much less likely than his sister.
So he turns out he's going to be, and he's turned to the movie, and he's got a ducks and a duck and a buddy, and I don't think he's got it, and he's got it right there, and he's certainly turned it up.
And I asked myself what he got up there.
Did he get it to make sure that it's about courage, resilience and loyalty?
If he finds out that Luke joined a armed army to overcome the government?
Once he got it, there were only boys in the universe, taken out of aunt Beru, and of course, this princess, which is really cool, but in most of the time, the heroes are waiting for the heroes to reward a meda, and a eye trick to thank them for the universe what he's done with the magic that he was born with?
Compare that to "The Magic of Oz" from 1939.
How does Dorothy bring her movie to a good end?
By opening up with everyone else and a leader.
That's the kind of world I would rather raise my children -- Oz, right? -- not in the world where guys are fighting with each other, which is pretty much like our current world.
Why is there so much power -- big M, power -- in the movies that exist for our children and so few yellow brickways?
There's a lot of good literature about influence that movies have on top of violent boys, and you should read them. It's very good.
But I haven't read as much about how boys deal with this influence.
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not give up the adequate role model I could use to find the culture of adults, where girls and boys are taught together.
I think there was a moment with the first kiss I really expected that the diverter started, because that's how a movie ends, right?
I finished my mission, I got the girl.
Why are you still looking around?
I don't know what to do.
The films are very aligned to defeat the badness and getting out of the reward, and there's not much room for other relationships and other travel.
It's almost like you're a boy, you're a mishy animal, and if you're a girl, you'd better bring your warbill.
There are outliers of it, and I'm going to defend the Disney Clouds in front of each of you.
But they're going to give a message to the boys that the boys aren't really the target audience.
They're fantastic at teaching girls how to sit down against the patriarchal address, but they don't necessarily show the boys how to respond to the patriarch.
There are no role models for them.
There are also some grand women who write new stories for our children and are so 3D and wonderful Hermine and Katniss, they're still war movies.
And of course, the most successful studio of all time produces a classic friend after the other, and each one of them is about a boy's journey, or a man or two men who are friends or a man or son or two men who are raising a small girl.
Until -- how many of you are sure -- this year, when finally she took the movie "Merida" -- legend of the highlights of the Highlands.
I recommend all of you. It's outdated on the Internet.
Remember what the critics said when "merida" came out?
"Oh, I can't believe that Pixar made a princess movie."
It's very good. Don't let it stop.
But like any of these movies, the Bechdel Test passed the pigeon test.
I don't know if you've heard about it before.
He hasn't really gained that well and made meaning in a good way, but maybe we're going to start a movement today.
Alison Bechdel is a comic book book book organ, and in the middle of the '80s, this conversation that she took with a friend about the evaluation of the movies she had seen.
It's simple. There are only three questions you need to ask: Is there more than a character in the movie, the female is odd, and says something?
Try to fulfill that premise.
And these women speak together at some point of the movie?
And is it about something else in their entertainment than the guy they like?
Did you feel? Thank you.
Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk to each other about anything.
This is something that happens. I saw it, and yet I see it quite rarely in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, I went to the cinema this week to see a very good movie, "Argo."
You remember? A lot of people on the Oscars, great players, a common set of comments about what a good Hollywood film is.
He falls through the heat doors with the ticklechle test.
I think it shouldn't, because a lot of the film -- I don't know if you saw it -- but a lot of the film plays a message in which men and women hide themselves during the delusion.
There are some good scenes where men in that hiding hide, afraid of having conversations and the great moment that one actor has to wake up through a door and say, "Come to bed, honey?"
Some Hollywood people are thinking of this way.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, under the 100 popular movies, what do you think many of them actually had female headquarters?
Elf. That's not nasty.
It's not as many occupants as the number of women we just elected in Congress, so that's good.
But there's a number that's bigger than this, and it's going to produce that space.
Last year, the New York Times published a study that government did.
It says that.
One out of five women in the U.S. has been suggesting that they've already been sexually aggressive in their lives.
I don't think that the guilt of the common entertainment culture is the fault.
I don't think kids have anything to do with it.
I don't think even that music videos and pornography have something to do with it right now, but it's going to go on, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think is that these are many sexual sex services.
Who are these guys? What do they learn?
What do they not get to learn?
Take yourself in the story that it's the task of a male hero to beat the gun with violence, and then pick up the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't talk?
Let's take that story up like this?
You know, as a parent who has the privilege of raising a daughter, just like those of you who do the same thing, we find this world and that statistics very alarms and we want to prepare it.
We have tools for the tools we have as "girlpower," and we hope that will help, but I also wonder if girls will protect them, if we do, at the same time, actively, or passive, to teach our sons to stop their procrastination.
Netflix folder is a means that we can do something very important, and I'm talking specifically to the fathers.
I think we have to just show our sons a new definition of venominess.
The definition of adversity is already changing.
You've read how the New Economy changes the roles of housewife and firewinners.
They get confused.
Our sons will have to find a way to adapt to taking a new relationship with each other, and I think we really have to show you that a real man is a person who is familiar with his sisters and respect her, and wants to stand on her side and ask them to really make the bad guys who are men who want to abuse women.
I think we should look for the Netflix circuit for films that are on the Bechdelel test, if we can find them, and look for the hero who are there, the real courage that makes people bring together and bring our sons to identify with these heroes and say, "I want to stand on their side because they're on their side.
When I asked my daughter who was her favorite character in "Star Wars," you know what she said?
Obi-Wan.
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
What have these two together?
Maybe it's not just the black dress.
I think these two figures are experts.
These are the two characters in the movie that are more than everyone else knows and their knowledge to share with other people, to help them to help them extend their potential.
And they're also leaders.
I like this kind of job for my daughter and I like this kind of job for my son.
I want more tasks like this.
I want less tasks in which my son is told, "Take out and struggle alone," and more tasks that he should join himself with a team, maybe a team that is seduced by a woman to help others become better people, better people, and better people like the magic spell of Oz.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the story of a small city child.
I don't know his name, but for that, his story.
He lives in a small village in the south of Somalias.
His village is near Mogadicu.
The drought was causing the poverty of this village and the newly degraded by the hunger.
When there was nothing left, what was he giving him, he left his village, and he went to the city, in this case, Mogadicu, the capital of Somalias.
When it comes, there is no possibility, no work, no way of doing it.
At the end, he comes in a tent camp outside of Mogadicu.
It might be a year, maybe it will go, but nothing.
One day, he's been approached by a man who invite him to lunch, then at dinner, after breakfast.
He meets this dynamic group of young people, and she gives him a chance.
He gets some money to buy new clothes and send money back home to her family.
He's introduced this young woman.
He eventually married.
He starts a new life.
His life has meaning.
On a nice day in Mogadicu, under the light of heaven, a car bomb goes into the air.
This little town child with big cities was self-drants and bombs, and these dynamic young people were al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization with connections with al <unk>aeda.
How could the story of a small town of a child who just tried to get to the city of the city, end up being able to blow himself up in the air?
He had waited.
He had waited for an opportunity to go to the future, to a road out, and it was the first chance that he offered him.
It was the first thing that he took out of a state that we call "Waithood."
And his story repeates over and over again in urban areas around the world.
It's the story of rights rights, unemployed urban youth, which causes in Johannesburg and London, and it's aspiring for something else than "Waithood."
Young people are going to promise from the city, from their large cities, opportunities, jobs, wealth, but young people have no share of wealth in their cities.
It's often the youth suffering under high unemployment.
By 2030, three of the five people in the cities will be more than 18 years.
If we don't engage young people in growth in cities, if we don't offer them any choice, then we will get "Waithood," which is the transition in terrorism, which is the violence and the gang, in the city, will make the cities 2.0.
In my birth, Mogadicu, 70 percent of the young people suffer from unemployed.
70 percent of them don't have jobs, don't go to school.
They don't actually do anything at all.
I drove back to Mogadicu last month, and I went to Madina Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of this broken hospital wondering what if I hadn't gone from here?
What if I had been forced to be the same state of the Waithood?
If I had become a terrorist?
I'm not sure what to answer.
The reason why I've been working on this month in Mogadicu was actually the orientation of a new leadership and entrepreneur.
I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
We sat down and we set up a brainstorming approach for the largest challenges in their city.
In the room, a young man, Aden.
He went to the University of Mogadu and graduated there in Mogadic.
There was no work and there was no opportunity.
I remember him saying that he had a university degree, unemployed and frustrated, the perfect goal was to become a member of al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes another run.
In Mogadics, the biggest obstacles are to get from A to B, the roads.
23 years of civil war broke the road system completely so the motorcycle is the best driving equipment.
And I saw the opportunity and I got her right there.
He opened a motorcycle business.
He started to rent motor boards to the local carriers that they couldn't afford otherwise.
With his family and friends, he bought 10 motorbikes and he kept his business in the next three years, at some hundreds of years,
How is this story different from the other?
What makes the difference?
I think it's his ability to see and use a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneurial spirit, and I believe that entrepreneurship can be the most effective tool for "Waithood."
It's strengthier to create the economic opportunities that they're trying so desperately.
You can teach young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who participated in one of my meetings: Mohamed Mohamoud, a flor.
He helped me train the entrepreneurial spirit of some young people who were at the top of the city, and show them how to innovate and develop entrepreneurship.
He's actually the first flora that's seen Mogadicu for 22 years, and until recently, Mohamed was there, they used artificial shrion that came out of the ship when you wanted to have flowers on his wedding.
When you ask someone, "When did you see fresh flowers last time?" the answer of many, many who grew up in the civil war, "No way."
So Mohamed saw a chance.
He founded a landscape of gardens with flowers.
He put a placement outside of Mogadicus, and he started to grow Tulm and Tensiles, which, as he said, could survive in the breadbed climate of Mogadicus.
He started to look at bus hours with flowers, private gardens and shops around the city, and he's working on the design of the first public park in Mogadic for 22 years.
There is no public park in Mogadicu.
He wants to create a place where families and young people come together, and as he says, the beautiful things can enjoy life.
It's just like the edge: He doesn't grow ropes because they need too much water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in this room, Mohamed's presence had a huge impact on the other young people in the room.
They never really thought about building a company.
They thought that they were working for an NGO or government, but this story, its innovation, had a strong impact on them.
They seductive their city as looking at a place of possibility.
And she claimed that they can be entrepreneurs, that they could make change full of the world.
At the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges in their city.
They had entrepreneurial solutions for local problems.
The inspiration of young people and the creation of a business spirit is a really big step, but young people need capital to actually implement their ideas.
They need certain skills and commitmenters to form and start business.
Get young people with the resources they need, connect them, give them the support they need to accomplish ideas, and you're going to create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship means more than just building a business.
It's about creating social effects.
Mohamed simply doesn't sell flowers.
He's selling hope.
His name is going to be called "the peace-loving" when it's created, changes the way people view their city.
The first thing that happened was that the street kids who help him to charge and maintain the motor marts.
He gave them the chance to get out of the light state of the wall,
These young companies have tremendous implications on their cities.
So my suggestion is, make young people aids, offer them a promotion, raise their own innovations, and you'll get more stories about flowers and peace-lojority policies rather than getting on car bomb bombs and "Waithood."
Thank you.
During my childhood in Maine, one of my favorite collaborators was to look for sanddollars on the coast of Maine because my parents claimed that happiness is happiness.
But these shells are hard to find.
They're surrounded by sandh, hardly seen.
But after a while, I had developed a routine.
I started to see shapes, and patterns that helped me collect them.
And that evolved to find a passion to find things, to a love for the past and the archaeology.
And when I finally started studying economics, I realized that the vision with my blind eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, my little beach in Maine grew up in a nice long distance, along the gas, and my sanddollines grew to the size of cities.
And that led me to use satellite imagery.
I had to see differently to map the past in a map.
So I want to show you how we see differently, for example, if we use infrared.
This is a site that is in eastern Egyptian delta called the Bees.
And the site appears brown. We're using infrared, and we're processing it with the wrong color, and this site suddenly becomes brightly bright.
And what you see here is chemical changes in the landscape through hardware and -- specialized in the old Egyptian.
What I'd like to share with you today is how we used satellite satellites to find a old-historic city that has been wearing the name of Weji and have been hacked for thousands of years.
And the Great Rejaui was the capital of the E.S.<unk>. on the order of four hundred years, in an era called the Medic Empire, about 10,000 years ago.
The site is in Egyptian Al-Fayyum, and it's very significant because in the Middle East there was a great renaissance for ancient modern art, architecture and religion.
"Our anthropologists have always known that the site of the Itj-Haui was somewhere near the pyramids, built by the two kings, shown here with the red crosses, but somewhere in this massive sword level.
This area is huge -- the area is four times three miles.
In the early days, the nil ran straight down to the Itj-tau, and as his walk changed and they went to the west, he was looking across the city.
So how do you find a vertical city in such a dense landscape?
They would randomly find the equivalent of finding the needle in the haystack, with eyes and baseball handwashing.
So we used NASA's type of typs to make a map of the landscape to see just by light change.
Where the clock used to be the rush.
But you see it in a very complex way, and it's very interesting, this light-looking area, indicating with the circle that appeared to us as a possible position for the city of Wej-jiti.
So we worked with Egyptian scientists to do the power of segregation, what you can see here.
This is like hysterical clamps in the ice, just instead of the layers of life that indicate climate change, you look for layers that represent human memory.
In a depth of five meters, under a thick layer of mud, we found a thick layer of clay.
This shows that this is a position for For Wej-Faui, in five meters, we can find a multi-lived layer of youth, all the way back to the Middle East, to the exact epinal era, where we think of the existence of the Itji.
We also found worksstone -- Karneol, <unk>Unclear and Achat -- which is what it shows here was a jewel who worked.
It might not look like much, but if you look at the most common rocks used by the emerald in the Middle East, you'll find these rocks.
So we found a fine layer of the schedules on this site that went back to the Middle Reich.
We also found evidence of a jewelry for the Dutch public, which is to show that this has been a very important city.
It didn't come up with a "Fj-ti" there, but we're going to go back to this site to draw a map.
What's more important is we have a grant to young Egyptians who are trained in satellite technology so that they're the ones who can do just the same big discoveries.
So I wanted to close my favorite transformation from the Middle East -- it might be written in the city of Wej-Faui a thousand years ago.
"You know, to share, the biggest job of all work is to share.
There's nothing like that in the country."
TED wasn't founded in 1984 C.C.
But in fact, ideas started in 1984 B.C. in a very long-disted city, again found from the top.
You can't compare that to the flapot on the beach with a little bit more than that.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I grew up in Taiwan as a daughter of a kalligraph, and I'm interested in my most beautiful memories, like my mother showed me the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese character.
I've been fascinated by this incredible language since then.
But for an outsider, it seems to be as uneasy as being like the Great Wall of China.
I've been wondering how I can take this wall in the last few years, so that anyone who has the interest in this complex language can understand it and learn it.
I thought that a new approach to learning Chinese would be useful.
I've learned from the age of the year to draw every single line for every possible piece of letters in the right sequence.
In the next 15 years, I learned new fonts every day.
Because we only have five minutes to spend a quick and simpler approach would be very useful.
A Chinese scholar understands about 20,000 characters.
They only need 1,000 characters for a simple type of fonts.
The most important 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the simple literature -- enough to understand street maps, craters and certain basic websites or newspapers.
Today, I start with eight characters to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as you can possibly as you can to square.
That's what becomes a "mund."
This person goes for a walk.
"Man."
If the reenter for "Foss," a man showed you warm arms, as if he were screaming, "Stay! I swear!" -- the typeface used to be escaped by the shape of the flame, but I like this idea, for example, the one that you love best.
This is a tree.
"Hoo."
That's a beacon."
The Oonne.
The "Mond."
The signatures for "Tufter" look like a salo tangle from the western Ocean.
These eight characters are radical.
They are the very end of the train to form a variety of fonts.
It's a human being.
If someone is standing behind it, it means "reem."
If it's more, two things like "gender" and three people will be a mass.
If a human is going to open up his arms, this person says, "It was so big."
The human in his mouth, he's just in imprisoned.
He's a "pute" -- like Jonas in the whale.
A tree is for a tree. Two trees are together for a "huggle."
Three are going to be on the front of "Wald."
Put a bumble tree under the tree, and you have a "hase."
Put a mouth up on top, it means "idiotic."
And just to remember, because a popular tree is pretty stupid.
Remember the fire?
Two flames are related to each other, and they're called "sit."
Three fires combined a lot of the corridors.
Put the fire under two trees, it means "bops."
For us, the sun is the source of wealth.
Two suns are going to make it "wull."
Three are dead together.
When the sun and the moon seem to be united, it means "invidence."
It can also be in context for the next day.
The sun goes over the horizon: sunrise.
The door. The doorboard is for the wall.
You place a mouth in your door, it means "wuggle."
Wit, be, beet. Is anyone there?
This person is pulling himself out of the door. "for escape."
On the left is the "wu."
Two women are going to be on a crossway.
In front of three women, this means "Eplillation."
We've seen 30 characters now.
And with this method, you can create the first eight radical 32 words from the first radiometer.
The next group, along with eight characters, is building another 32 words.
You can learn a few hundred characters like an eight-year-old Chinese child.
If we can use these typeface sounds, we start putting them together.
For example, mountain and fire puts in the fire Mountain, so a "Vulbrate."
We know Japan is the country on the front sun.
This is the sun with the great leap, because Japan is east of China.
A sun along with the origin is called "Japan."
A human is behind Japan?
"Japaner."
The bill on the left is two mountains tied down.
In classical Chinese, it means "Exil," because Chinese-cauts sent their political enemies to the hills.
Today, "Exil" has become "one" in the first.
A mouth that says where it's going, it's for "rawn."
That's the slide that reminds me of leaving the stage. Thank you very much.
