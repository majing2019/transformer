Thank you very much indeed.
So I'd like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China, the night I met my husband.
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking.
So I went to a party.
I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie, and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar, there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations.
What a gift it was to the eager, young foreign correspondent that I was then.
I'd pump him for information, I'm mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write.
I talk to him for hours.
Only months later, I discover who he really was.
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association.
"I don't understand. Soybeans?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."
"Well, how long would you have talked to me if I told you we're in soybeans?"
I said, "You jerk."
Only jerk wasn't the word I used.
I said, "You could've gotten me fired."
And he said, "Let's get married."
"Travel the world and have lots of kids."
So we did.
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be.
He was a Chinese scholar who later, in his 60s, got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
He spoke six languages, he played 15 musical instruments, he was a licensed pilot, he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator, he was an expert in swine nutrition, dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir, and we did travel the country, and the world, and we did have a lot of kids.
We followed my job, and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn't do.
So when we found the cancer, it doesn't seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other, we believed that, if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough, and we worked hard enough, we could keep him from dying ever.
And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
The surgeon emerged from the surgery.
What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say: "We got it all."
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely.
It turned out to be a rare, exceedingly aggressive type, with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most.
And yet, he did not die.
Mysteriously, he lived on.
He coached Little League for our son.
He built a playhouse for our daughter.
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists.
I'm looking for a cure.
So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months.
So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
It makes him so sick, he has to quit it, yet still he lives on.
Then another year goes by.
Two years go by.
More specialists.
We take the kids to Italy.
We take the kids to Australia.
And then more years pass, and the cancer begins to grow.
This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
They're exotic. They're experimental.
They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
The cancer begins to shrink, and for the third time, we've dodged death.
So now I ask you, how do I feel when the time finally comes and there's another dark night, sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
This time it's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I've never met before tells me that Terence is dying, perhaps tonight.
So what do I say when he says, "What do you want me to do?"
There's another drug out there.
It's newer. It's more powerful.
He started it just two weeks ago.
Perhaps there's still hope ahead.
So what do I say?
I say, "Keep him alive if you can."
And Terence died six days later.
So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
It was an exhilarating fight, and I'd repeat the fight today without a moment's hesitation.
We fought together, we lived together.
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious.
It was also an expensive fight.
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care, and of healthcare for all of us.
And for me, for us, we pushed the fight right over the edge, and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day: "Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."
We never got the chance to say goodbye.
We never thought it was the end.
We always had hope.
So what do we make of all of this?
Being a journalist, after Terence died, I wrote a book, "The Cost Of Hope."
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did, why he did what he did, why everyone around us did what they did.
And what did I discover?
Well, one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper, the advance directive, to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
Yet I had that piece of paper.
We both did.
And they were readily available.
I had them right at hand.
Both of them said the same thing: Do nothing if there is no further hope.
I knew Terence's wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
Yet we never got to no further hope.
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands, we just kept redefining hope.
I believed I could keep him from dying, and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way.
Right up until days before his death, I felt strongly and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally, that I could keep him from dying ever.
Now, what do the experts call this?
They say it's denial.
It's a strong word, isn't it?
Yet I will tell you that denial isn't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through.
And I hear the medical professionals say, "Well, we'd like to do such-and-such, but the family's in denial.
The family won't listen to reason.
They're in denial.
How can they insist on this treatment at the end?
It's so clear, yet they're in denial."
Now, I think this maybe isn't a very useful way of thinking.
It's not just families either.
The medical professionals too, you out there, you're in denial too.
You want to help. You want to fix.
You want to do.
You've succeeded in everything you've done, and having a patient die, well, that must feel like failure.
I saw it firsthand.
Just days before Terence died, his oncologist said, "Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."
Days before he died.
Yet Ira Byock, the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said, "You know, the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."
So what the experts call "denial," I call "hope," and I'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design.
You just redefine denial and hope, and it becomes a feature of being human.
It's not a bug.
It's a feature.
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night, and I believed it.
Maybe I wanted to believe it.
And during Terence's illness, I, we, we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too.
Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt, it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story, our story of us as fighters, the story of us as invincible, and for the doctors, the story of themselves as healers.
So what do we need?
Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.
People did mention hospice, but I wouldn't listen.
Hospice was for people who were dying, and Terence wasn't dying.
As a result, he spent just four days in hospice, which I'm sure, as you all know, is a pretty typical outcome, and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end.
We have a noble path to curing the disease, patients and doctors alike, but there doesn't seem to be a noble path to dying.
Dying is seen as failing, and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together, but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye, and maybe our new story will be about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
Terence loved poetry, and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets.
So I'll give you a couple lines from him.
This is a poem about Mark Antony.
You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero, Cleopatra's guy?
Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
And he's been a pretty good general.
He's won all the fights, he's eluded all the people that are out to get him, and yet this time, finally, he's come to the city of Alexandria and realized he's lost.
The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
They're singing.
And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
And he suddenly knows he's been deserted by the gods, and it's time to let go.
And the poet tells him what to do.
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye, a goodbye that's fit for a hero.
"As if long-prepared, as if courageous, as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city, approach the window with a firm step, and with emotion, but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward, as a last enjoyment, listen to the sounds, the exquisite instruments of the musical troops, and bid her farewell, the Alexandria you are losing."
That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life, a goodbye for a man for whom anything, well, almost anything, was possible, a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
And isn't that what we're missing?
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.
It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope.
Hope isn't a bug.
It's a feature.
Thank you.

You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains, far from these beautiful mountains, where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different, which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product.
And why not?
After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few, but a fundamental human right for all.
And what is happiness?
Happiness is the freedom of choice.
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.
Where does choice come from?
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
Well, one way to express choice is through the market.
Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately, the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market.
In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth, Ethiopia.
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north, people could not access or entitle themselves to that food.
That was a turning point for my life.
Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.
And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large, small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated, compared to 40 percent in Asia.
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare, compared to 144 in Asia.
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America, and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice, and therefore without much freedom.
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty.
He comes to the market when prices are lowest, with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest, because he has no choice.
She comes back to the market some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists?
Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz, in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient, but poor.
Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational and profit-minded just like everybody else.
Well, we don't need, now, any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business.
And that business is agriculture.
Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic.
Well, what happened over the last 25 years?
Did Africa feed itself?
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
I think we're all in this room, probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years, where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago, where food production per capita has stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water.
Like its agriculture, Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market, and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets, are extremely high.
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as market information, grades and standards, and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals, and situations where there are deficits, for example.
It also has very high cost implications.
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence of grades and standards and market information, sacks have to be constantly changed.
And this leads to very high handling costs.
For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa, come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind -- trusting that they're going to have some sort of demand for their produce, and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market, the nearest local market they know -- where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa's farmers have to bear.
And in my view, there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face.
In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers, but also direct implications for food security.
To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002, Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
That in turn, because of the weak marketing system, led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis, to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
This is a tragic example of arrested development, or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia, but happens over and over, all over Africa.
Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
I am here to tell you that change is in the air.
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions, or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly, that markets don't happen by themselves.
In the 1980s, it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right.
There was a very influential book about that, which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
When conditions are right, we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa, just like anywhere else.
Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia, after nearly 30 years abroad.
I did so for a simple reason.
After having spent more than a decade understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets, I decided it was time to do something about it.
I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept, is not new to the world.
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done.
From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market, which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances, and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture, and the rise of Chicago to a global market, agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
Now, over the last century, we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries, and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa -- products produced mainly in the south -- are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
But that is actually changing.
And we're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example, where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year.
This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology, aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago, 2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world.
Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia's needs and realities, Ethiopia's small farmers.
So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
We're creating a system that serves all market actors, that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia, we've done something rather unique, which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective, or what we call the ECX Edge.
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself.
And this is because one of the things we've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
You've got one donor trying to develop market information, another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards, another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
In our approach in Ethiopia, we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem, or environment, in which trade takes place.
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system, which will initially start as an open outcry, because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually, without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things, simply see the trading that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country, in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system, to assure that payment is done appropriately, in the right amount and at the right time, so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
Obviously, we work with exchange actors, and as we're developing the exchange market itself, we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework, the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
So, in fact, our proclamation is going to parliament next month.
What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country, using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers.
What this does is transforms, fundamentally, the farmers' relationship to the market.
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market, eight to 10 kilometers away on average, and sell whatever they happened to have, without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
And they start to think national, and even global.
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions, but also planting decisions, on the basis of information coming from the futures price market.
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium.
So all of this will transform farmers.
It will also transform the way traders do business.
It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
Can Ethiopia do this?
It seems very ambitious.
But it will create new opportunities.
We believe that this initiative requires great political will, and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector, and really even the underlying legal framework.
We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium, which starts in about eight months.
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today.
We believe that the stakes are high, but that the returns will be even greater.
ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market in agricultural commodities.
Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
And we feel that over the next five years, if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market, and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa's grain production, and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
So the potential is there.
The will is there.
The commitment is there.
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture, and to change Africa.
So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
Thank you very much.
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed.
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean, I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war.
So we were up on top of our bunk beds.
And on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry.
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge.
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today, let me tell you the true story -- -- which is my sister's a little bit on the clumsy side.
Somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all, suddenly Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor.
Now I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground.
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible.
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before ...
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, for which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn't even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior.
And I saw my sister's face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled.
So I did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy.
And if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times before.
I said, "Amy, Amy, wait. Don't cry. Don't cry.
Did you see how you landed?
No human lands on all fours like that.
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."
Now that was cheating, because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn.
Of course, this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past.
And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn.
And the latter won out.
Instead of crying, instead of ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me, instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...
... with one broken leg.
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain.
What we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology, which is the reason that I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning.
When I first started talking about this research outside of academia, out with companies and schools, the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph.
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph.
This graph looks boring, but this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.
And this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data.
What we found is -- If I got this data back studying you here in the room, I would be thrilled, because there's very clearly a trend that's going on there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters.
The fact that there's one weird red dot that's up above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are, I saw you earlier -- that's no problem.
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot.
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error.
And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data.
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos.
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit?
Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two.
But if I'm interested in potential, if I'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, what we're doing is we're creating the cult of the average with science.
If I asked a question like, "How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?"
scientists change the answer to "How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?"
and then we tailor the class right towards the average.
Now if you fall below the average on this curve, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you're either depressed or you have a disorder, or hopefully both.
We're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10, so you keep coming back over and over again.
We'll go back into your childhood if necessary, but eventually what we want to do is make you normal again.
But normal is merely average.
And what I posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average.
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers, what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say, why?
Why is it that some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual ability, athletic ability, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, your resiliency in the face of challenge, your sense of humor?
Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you.
Because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average, but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide.
The reason this graph is important to me is, when I turn on the news, it seems like the majority of the information is not positive, in fact it's negative.
Most of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters.
And very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world.
What that's doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome -- which, if you know people who've been to medical school, during the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen, suddenly you realize you have all of them.
I have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story.
Bobo married Amy the unicorn.
Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School, and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy."
Which, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare.
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause.
See what we're finding is it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.
And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time.
When I applied to Harvard, I applied on a dare.
I didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college.
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they allowed me to go.
Suddenly, something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality.
When I went there, I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there.
Even if you're in a classroom full of people smarter than you, you'd be happy just to be in that classroom, which is what I felt.
But what I found there is, while some people experience that, when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.
I was an officer of Harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years.
And what I found in my research and my teaching is that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or their physics.
Their brain was focused on the competition, the workload, the hassles, the stresses, the complaints.
When I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up -- I know some of you have heard of it.
When they'd come to visit me, they'd look around, they'd say, "This freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's from the movie "Harry Potter," which it does.
This is Hogwart's from the movie "Harry Potter" and that's Harvard.
And when they see this, they say, "Shawn, why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard?
Seriously, what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?"
Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness.
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness.
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world.
And if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality.
What we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by I.Q.
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat.
I talked to a boarding school up in New England, probably the most prestigious boarding school, and they said, "We already know that.
So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we also have a wellness week.
And we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression.
Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying.
Wednesday night is eating disorders.
Thursday night is elicit drug use.
And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness."
I said, "That's most people's Friday nights."
Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all.
Silence on the phone.
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school, but just so you know, that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week.
What you've done is you've outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive."
The absence of disease is not health.
Here's how we get to health: We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success.
In the last three years, I've traveled to 45 different countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn.
And what I found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful.
And if I'm more successful, then I'll be happier.
That undergirds most of our parenting styles, our managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior.
And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons.
First, every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like.
You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better school, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change your sales target.
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there.
What we've done is we've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society.
And that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier.
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order.
If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative, neutral or stressed.
Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise.
In fact, what we've found is that every single business outcome improves.
Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed.
You're 37 percent better at sales.
Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed.
Which means we can reverse the formula.
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently.
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of.
Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive, has two functions.
Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way.
We've found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive.
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully.
We've done these things in research now in every single company that I've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day.
And at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world, not for the negative, but for the positive first.
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it.
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters.
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand.
And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness.
We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network.
And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies, what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but create a real revolution.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.
When we think about how people work, the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money, and the moment we give people money, we can direct them to work one way, we can direct them to work another way.
This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.
And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like.
At the same time, if you think about it, there's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.
If you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains, do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?
No, they are full of misery.
In fact, it's all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold, challenging circumstances.
And if people were just trying to be happy, the moment they would get to the top, they would say, "This was a terrible mistake.
I'll never do it again."
"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."
But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways.
And for me personally, I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me.
This was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier.
And he came one day back to campus.
And he told me the following story: He said that for more than two weeks, he was working on a PowerPoint presentation.
He was working in a big bank.
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.
And he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs, tables, information.
He stayed late at night every day.
And the day before it was due, he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss, and his boss wrote him back and said, "Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."
And the guy was deeply depressed.
Now at the moment when he was working, he was actually quite happy.
Every night he was enjoying his work, he was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.
But knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed.
So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor.
And to start with, we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos, and we asked them to build with Legos.
And for some people, we gave them Legos and we said, "Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?
We'll pay you three dollars for it."
And people said yes, and they built with these Legos.
And when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table, and we said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for $2.70?"
If they said yes, we gave them another one.
And when they finished, we asked them, "Do you want to build another one?" for $2.40, $2.10, and so on, until at some point people said, "No more. It's not worth it for me."
This was what we called the meaningful condition.
People built one Bionicle after another.
After they finished every one of them, we put them under the table.
And we told them that at the end of the experiment, we will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them, we will put them back in the boxes, and we will use it for the next participant.
There was another condition.
This other condition was inspired by David, my student.
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.
And if you remember the story about Sisyphus, Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill, and when he almost got to the end, the rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.
And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills, at least he would have some sense of progress.
Also, if you look at prison movies, sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished, they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.
There's something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating.
So in the second condition of this experiment, that's exactly what we did.
We asked people, "Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"
And if they said yes, they built it.
Then we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"
And if they said yes, we gave them a new one, and as they were building it, we took apart the one that they just finished.
And when they finished that, we said, "Would you like to build another one, this time for 30 cents less?"
And if they said yes, we gave them the one that they built and we broke.
So this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes.
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions?
The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven -- in the meaningful condition versus the Sisyphus condition.
And by the way, we should point out that this was not a big meaning.
People were not curing cancer or building bridges.
People were building Bionicles for a few cents.
And not only that, everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.
But even the small meaning made a difference.
Now we had another version of this experiment.
In this other version of the experiment, we didn't put people in this situation, we just described to them the situation, much as I am describing to you now, and we asked them to predict what the result would be.
What happened?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle.
So people understand that meaning is important, they just don't understand the magnitude of the importance, the extent to which it's important.
There was one other piece of data we looked at.
If you think about it, there are some people who love Legos and some people who don't.
And you would speculate that the people who love Legos will build more Legos, even for less money, because after all, they get more internal joy from it.
And the people who love Legos less will build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.
And that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.
There was a very nice correlation between love of Lego and the amount of Legos people built.
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?
In that condition the correlation was zero.
There was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built, which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people's eyes, we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.
We basically eliminated it.
Soon after I finished running this experiment, I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.
I can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.
And this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building.
And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company.
And the week before I showed up, the CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers, and canceled the project.
And I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I've ever talked to.
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments, and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.
And I asked them, I said, "How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"
And everybody raised their hand.
I said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"
And everybody raised their hand.
I asked them, "How many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"
And they didn't really raise their hands, but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports.
And then I asked them, I said, "What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.
They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do.
He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization.
He could have asked them to build some prototypes, some next-generation prototypes, and seen how they would work.
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.
And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.
If the CEO, just like our participants, thought the essence of meaning is unimportant, then he [wouldn't] care.
And he would tell them, "At the moment I directed you in this way, and now that I am directing you in this way, everything will be okay."
But if you understood how important meaning is, then you would figure out that it's actually important to spend some time, energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they're doing.
The next experiment was slightly different.
We took a sheet of paper with random letters, and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other.
That was the task.
And people did the first sheet.
And then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money, and so on and so forth.
And we had three conditions.
In the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet, found all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter.
The experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say "uh huh" and put it on the pile next to them.
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
And in the third condition, the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder.
What happened in those three conditions?
In this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.
So low numbers mean that people worked harder. They worked for much longer.
In the acknowledged condition, people worked all the way down to 15 cents.
At 15 cents per page, they basically stopped these efforts.
In the shredder condition, it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet.
And this is basically the result we had before.
You shred people's efforts, output, you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.
But I should point out, by the way, that in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.
They could have done not so good work, because they realized that people were just shredding it.
So maybe the first sheet you would do good work, but then you see nobody is really testing it, so you would do more and more and more.
So in fact, in the shredder condition, people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it.
But what about the ignored condition?
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder.
Now there's good news and bad news here.
The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.
The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done, scanning it and saying "uh huh," that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people's motivations.
So the good news is that adding motivation doesn't seem to be so difficult.
The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy, and if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.
So this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation.
The next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation.
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble.
And I don't know about you, but every time I assemble one of those, it takes me much longer, it's much more effortful, it's much more confusing.
I put things in the wrong way.
I can't say enjoy those pieces.
I can't say I enjoy the process.
But when I finish it, I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones.
And there's an old story about cake mixes.
So when they started cake mixes in the '40s, they would take this powder and they would put it in a box, and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in, stir some water in it, mix it, put it in the oven, and -- voila! -- you had cake.
But it turns out they were very unpopular.
People did not want them.
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.
Maybe the taste was not good.
No, the taste was great.
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say, "Here is my cake."
No, no, no, it was somebody else's cake.
It was as if you bought it in the store.
It didn't really feel like your own.
So what did they do?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.
Now you had to break the eggs and add them.
You had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.
Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine.
Now I think a little bit like the IKEA effect, by getting people to work harder, they actually got them to love what they're doing to a higher degree.
So how do we look at this question experimentally?
We asked people to build some origami.
We gave them instructions on how to create origami, and we gave them a sheet of paper.
And these were all novices, and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane.
But then we told them, we said, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
How much do you want to pay for it?"
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.
And we had two types of people.
We had the people who built it, and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers.
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami, and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally.
Now you could say, if you were a builder, do you think that, "Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it?"
Or do you think, "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"
Which one of those two is correct?
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more, they thought that everybody would see the world in their view.
They thought everybody else would love it more as well.
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect.
We tried to make it more difficult.
So for some people we gave the same task.
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions.
At the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami.
For some people we just eliminated that.
So now this was tougher. What happened?
Well in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.
Now when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing: Builders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.
When you looked at the hard instructions, the effect was larger.
Why? Because now the builders loved it even more.
They put all this extra effort into it.
And evaluators? They loved it even less.
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version.
Of course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.
Now think about kids.
Imagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"
Your memories and associations and so on.
Most people would say for a lot, a lot of money -- on good days.
But imagine this was slightly different.
Imagine if you did not have your kids, and one day you went to the park and you met some kids, and they were just like your kids.
And you played with them for a few hours.
And when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way, just before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale."
How much would you pay for them now?
Most people say not that much.
And this is because our kids are so valuable, not just because of who they are, but because of us, because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection.
And by the way, if you think that IKEA instructions are not good, think about the instructions that come with kids.
Those are really tough.
By the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.
Which comes to tell you one more thing, which is, much like our builders, when they look at the creature of their creation, we don't see that other people don't see things our way.
Let me say one last comment.
If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx, Adam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency.
He gave an example of a pin factory.
He said pins have 12 different steps, and if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.
But if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on, production can increase tremendously.
And indeed, this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.
Karl Marx, on the other hand, said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing.
And if you make all 12 steps, you care about the pin.
But if you make one step every time, maybe you don't care as much.
And I think that in the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx, but the reality is that we've switched and now we're in the knowledge economy.
And you can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?
Is efficiency still more important than meaning?
I think the answer is no.
I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it, are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on, all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.
So when we think about labor, we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing, but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it -- meaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.
And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them, how do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation, and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees, I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier.
Thank you very much.
What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city, studio to studio, interview to interview, serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.
Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down, but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...
so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now, a world stuck in fast-forward.
A world obsessed with speed, with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more into less and less time.
Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock.
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again -- "These days even instant gratification takes too long."
And if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?
No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.
And even things that are by their very nature slow -- we try and speed them up too.
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to, you know, salute the sun, but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples, and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
But there's a very serious point, and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life, we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us.
We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives -- on our health, our diet, our work, our relationships, the environment and our community.
And sometimes it takes a wake-up call, doesn't it, to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives, instead of actually living them; that we're living the fast life, instead of the good life.
And I think for many people, that wake-up call takes the form of an illness.
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says, "I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time, or the patience, or the tranquility, to be with the other person, to listen to them.
And my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son, and I found that at the end of day, I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know, I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here, paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page, and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate, the most tender moment of the day, when a dad sits down to read to his son, became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills, a clash between my speed and his slowness.
And this went on for some time, until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people.
And one of them made reference to a series of books called "The One-Minute Bedtime Story."
And I wince saying those words now, but my first reaction at the time was very different.
My first reflex was to say, "Hallelujah -- what a great idea!
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."
But thankfully, a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different, and I took a step back, and I thought, "Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"
And I put away the newspaper -- and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there, and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture, and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
And I had two questions in my head.
The first was, how did we get so fast?
And the second is, is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down?
Now, if you think about how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.
You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.
But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself.
In other cultures, time is cyclical.
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.
You either use it, or lose it.
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.
And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation.
Time is scarce, so what do we do?
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?
We try and do more and more with less and less time.
We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line -- a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach, but a finish line nonetheless.
And I guess that the question is, is it possible to break free from that mindset?
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable: they're slowing down, and finding that, although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill, the opposite turns out to be true: that by slowing down at the right moments, people find that they do everything better.
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better; they work better; they live better.
And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the "International Slow Movement."
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets, are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable.
They want to get back to slower rhythms.
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy, but has spread right across Europe and beyond.
And in this, towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape, so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another.
So they might curb traffic, or put in a park bench, or some green space.
And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts, because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City, it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town, that we believe that in the 21st century, slowness has a role to play.
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick-fix mentality you find in conventional medicine.
And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine, which tend to tap into sort of slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies, and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.
But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation, clearly have some kind of benefit.
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work, and what we might learn from them.
Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there.
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford, and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine, a men's magazine, and it said on the front, "How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."
So, you know, even sex is on a stopwatch these days.
Now, you know, I like a quickie as much as the next person, but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper, sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents, and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they, when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."
Now, we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric, but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops, or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex.
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.
The workplace.
Right across much of the world -- North America being a notable exception -- working hours have been coming down.
And Europe is an example of that, and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less, and also that their hourly productivity goes up.
Now, clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in France -- too much, too soon, too rigid.
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries, are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic.
And Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth, and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy.
And if you go beyond sort of the country level, down at the micro-company level, more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug -- to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room, to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back -- mobile phones, during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought.
It's not just, though, these days, adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s, and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework, more tutoring, more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.
And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me to write to their parents, to help them slow down, to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill.
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well, and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month, so that people can, you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years, and now they're discovering that less can be more.
So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of 13, and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said, "What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said, "No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."
And just this last month, the exam results came in, and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent on average last year.
And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much, are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks; they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars, to the point that would make your eyes water.
But they lack spark; they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside -- they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools, and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen -- telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard, if they put on the brakes, if they do less, but give time to things, the time that things need, to enjoy them, to savor them.
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think -- "Slow Down!" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.
So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same: that less is very often more, that slower is very often better. But that said, of course, it's not that easy to slow down, is it?
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness, and that's true, but that's not all of it.
I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time.
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway, you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.
But why is it so hard to slow down?
I think there are various reasons.
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger, deeper questions.
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness, so that we don't have to ask, am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason -- why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker," for being somebody who gives up.
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous with being stupid.
I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement, or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo, and to say that yes, sometimes slow is not the answer, that there is such a thing as "bad slow."
You know, I got stuck on the M25, which is a ring road around London, recently, and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you, that's really bad slow.
But the new idea, the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement, is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.
And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work.
Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations.
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think, are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system, there's too much busyness, and it's time to find, or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.
Another encouraging sign, I think, is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world, in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status -- China, Brazil, Thailand, Poland, and so on -- these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement, many people in them, and there's a debate going on in their media, on the streets.
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying, "Well, we like that aspect of what you've got, but we're not so sure about that."
So all of that said, is it, I guess, is it possible?
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down? And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes.
And I present myself as Exhibit A, a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed-aholic.
I still love speed. You know, I live in London, and I work as a journalist, and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness, and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.
I play squash and ice hockey, two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.
But I've also, over the last year or so, got in touch with my inner tortoise.
And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously.
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have.
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.
And perhaps, the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper, richer, stronger.
And for me, I guess, the litmus test for whether this would work, and what it would mean, was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know, at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer, so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket, and I just slow down to his pace and we read.
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock, they don't do quality time, where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
It's become my reward at the end of the day, something I really cherish.
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon, which goes a little bit like this: a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on another book tour, and I had my bags packed.
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi, and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together, and put a sticker of his favorite character, Tintin, on the front.
And he said to me, or he handed this to me, and I read it, and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card for being the best story reader in the world."
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."
Thank you very much.
I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development.
In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in Africa.
In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.
The DRC is a dangerous place.
In the past 10 years, five million people have died due to a war in the east.
But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC.
There are many health issues as well.
In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults.
This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected.
And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.
Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost.
And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien.
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.
It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay.
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.
Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them.
He said there's just not in demand.
It's not surprising, because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms.
Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions.
They like the generics.
And as a marketer, I found that curious.
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity.
They name the condoms things like Vive, "to live" or Trust.
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom?
Sex!
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this.
Their marketing is slightly different.
The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is.
Some brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing: understanding who's the audience.
And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in].
It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these.
But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples, the young women, the young men -- whose lives depend on it.
And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.
It might just save their lives.
Thank you.
This is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
It was a great place to grow up, but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world.
Half the city is already below sea level.
In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
These are my mother's, at the top -- although that's not her car, it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof -- and that's my sister's, below.
Fortunately, they and other family members got out in time, but they lost their homes, and as you can see, just about everything in them.
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways.
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar.
Climate change is affecting our homes, our communities, our way of life. We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity.
This talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home, the Earth.
The changes in these times won't affect us all equally.
There are important distributional consequences, and they're not what you always might think.
In New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable.
For those in vulnerable, low-lying nations, how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried? And where will your people go?
And how will they cope in a foreign land?
Will there be tensions over immigration, or conflicts over competition for limited resources?
It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.
Like it or not, ready or not, this is our future.
Sure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.
That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
But while there might be some short-term individual winners, our collective losses will far outweigh them.
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events.
The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security, while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond.
So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
I'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with adapting to violent storms and floods.
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans, with sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.
And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country.
They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way, but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.
For example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike, when others on neighboring lots clearly did not.
And around the world, satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.
But as important as technology and infrastructure are, perhaps the human element is even more critical.
We need better planning and systems for evacuation.
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis, and why.
While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation, others who did refused to leave as the storm approached, often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets.
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act — it spells "PETS" — to change that.
Second, preparing for heat and drought.
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma, while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population, depends on rainfall for its livelihood.
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation, are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water, but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest.
It's giving them access to affordable credit.
It's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.
It's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world.
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues, Chicago became a recognized leader, tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers, outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees, creating cool white or vegetated green roofs.
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof, which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.
Washington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation in new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners.
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy, and therefore money, the emissions that cause climate change, and they also reduce stormwater runoff.
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.
Third, adapting to rising seas.
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture, even major cities. This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.
That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.
Infrastructure is going to be affected.
Airports around the world are located on the coast.
It makes sense, right? There's open space, the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport, with 16 inches or more of flooding.
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees.
But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine. For example, planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment, as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater, causing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste.
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system.
Beyond these technical solutions, our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change.
For example, in land use, which areas do you want to protect, through adding a seawall, for example, alter, by raising buildings, or retreat from, to allow the migration of important natural systems, such as wetlands or beaches?
Other examples to consider. In the U.K., the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.
The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right, but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms, as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise, and to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.
But back above ground, these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive. In fact, in New York, San Francisco and London, designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind.
I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.
But now, a word of caution.
Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts.
Why? Well, there are no experts.
We're entering uncharted territory, and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past.
"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past, and plan accordingly, and this principle governs much of our engineering, our design of critical infrastructure, city water systems, building codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms.
We're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.
The larger point I'm trying to make is this.
It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities, our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk, and to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive, and it's up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same, even while they address the underlying causes of climate change.
There are no quick fixes.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
We're all learning by doing.
But the operative word is doing.
Thank you.
I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.
I don't have much time to do it.
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.
The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.
It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level, and it transcends all the baggage that normally comes with what people would call, sort of, a rational conclusion to something.
And it concludes in something that you see here, that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.
The second -- the second is that this process does not have a signature.
There is no authorship. Architects are obsessed with authorship.
This is something that has editing and it has teams.
In fact, we no longer see, within this process, the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out.
And the third is that it challenges -- and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why, connect all these things -- but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.
High modernists said, we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic.
Almost anything can happen within them.
I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility."
Turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.
So, this is the promise of high modernism: within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.
But as we're seeing, operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters.
And so, with this sort of idea, what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day, or whatever seems to be the most immediate need, starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it, of anything else could ever happen.
And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility, something that we call "compartmentalized flexibility."
And the idea is that you, within that continuum, identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.
They can be pushed off-center a little bit, but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.
With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.
Now I'm going to talk about -- I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams, and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.
With the library staff and the library board, we settled on two core positions.
This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years, the evolution of the book and other technologies.
This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book, and our position was, books are technology -- that's something people forget -- but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.
The second premise -- and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first -- is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America, had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.
OK, now, this I'll come back to later, but something, actually, the librarians at first said, "No, this isn't our mandate.
Our mandate is media, and particularly the book."
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.
The upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.
Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere.
We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book; and so we'll use this approach.
And what we saw were buildings that were very generic.
And, worse, not only did we see buildings that were very generic -- so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area -- but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.
And in this case, what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.
And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.
Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize. Put those things whose evolution we could predict -- and I don't mean that we could say whatever would actually happen in the future, but we have some certainty of the spectrum of whatever would happen in the future -- put those in boxes designed specifically for it, and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.
So that was the core idea.
Now, we had to convince the library that social roles was equally important to media in order to get them to accept this.
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.
That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say, "You know what? We haven't touched it, but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.
Two-thirds of it is already dedicated -- that's the white band below -- the thing you said isn't important -- is already dedicated to social functions."
So, once we had presented that back to them, they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.
We got the right to go back to first principles -- that's the third diagram. We recombined everything.
And then we started making new decisions.
What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library, specifically in terms of square footage.
On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms -- sort of combs, collective programs.
And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces; things like reading rooms, whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.
So that literally was the design of the building.
They signed it, and to their chagrin, we came back a week later, and we presented them this.
OK? And, as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.
OK? We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally.
The things on the -- on the left-hand side of the diagram, those are the boxes.
We sized them into five compartments.
They're super-efficient. We had a very low budget to work with.
We pushed them around on the site to make very literal contextual relationships.
The reading room should be able to see the water.
The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.
So, you see the five platforms -- those are the boxes -- within each one a very discrete thing is happening.
The area in between is sort of an urban continuum, these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.
To give you some sense of the power of this idea, the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.
It's literally built in a very inexpensive way -- it is a parking garage for books.
It just so happens to be in the sixth through 10th floor of the building, but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.
And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey decimal system on one continuous run: no matter how it grows or contracts within the building, it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that we've all experienced in public libraries.
And so this was the final operation, which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter, and to hold onto them with a skin.
That skin serves double duty, again for economics.
One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building; it is a structural element. But its dimensions were designed not only for structure, but also for holding on every piece of glass.
The glass was then -- I'll just use the word impregnated -- but it had a layer of metal that was called "stressed metal."
That metal acts as a micro louver, so from the exterior of the building the sun sees it as totally opaque, but from the interior it's entirely transparent.
So, now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.
Let's see if I can find it. For anyone who is -- gets motion sickness, I apologize.
So this is the building.
And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building, the public thought -- saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.
And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians. They said, "Look, we don't know what it is, but we know it's everything that we need it to be based on the observations that we've done about the program."
This is going into one of the entries.
So it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.
So now we're going into what we call the reading room -- sorry, living room.
This is actually a program that we invented with the library.
It was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space.
There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown Seattle, but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain.
So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything, including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.
That was the main sort of technology area in the building.
You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.
Now up.
This is actually the place that we put into the building so I could propose to my wife. Right there.
She said yes.
I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.
I can show this to you later.
But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral, because I think it's, as I said, the most -- this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building.
You dizzy yet?
OK, so here, this is the book spiral.
So, it's very indiscernible, but it's actually a continuous stair stepping.
It allows you to, on one city block, go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.
OK, now I'm going to go back, and so I'm going to hit a second project.
I'm going to go very, very quickly through this.
Now this is the Dallas Theater. It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said, "We need you to do a new building. We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years, but because of that temporary space, we've become an infamous theater company.
Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle, with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."
And the very fact that they worked on a provisional space meant that for Beckett they could blow out a wall; they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.
So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building that could keep the -- be a pristine building, but keep this kind of experimental nature.
And the second is, they were what we call a multi-form theater: they do different kinds of performances in repertory.
So they in the morning will do something in arena, then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.
And so they needed to be able to quickly transform between different theater organizations, and for operational budget reasons, this actually no longer happens in pretty much any multi-form theater in the United States, so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.
So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head: to take those things that were previously defined as front-of-house and back-of-house and stack them -- above house and below house -- and to create sort of what we started to call a theater machine.
We invest the money in the operation of the building.
It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere: wherever you place it, the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances.
And it allowed us to go back to first principles, and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.
And at the push of a button, it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium thrust and, in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor in a very quick transfiguration.
So in fact, we can go, using operational budget, we can -- sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve what was no longer achievable in operational cost.
And that means that the artistic director now has a palette that he or she can choose from between a series of forms and a series of processions, because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated.
So an artistic director has the ability to show -- have a performance that enters in a Wagnerian procession, shows the first act in thrust, the intermission in a Greek procession, second act in arena, and so forth.
So I'm going to show you what this actually means.
This is the theater up close.
Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.
The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure, so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.
Portions can be opened, so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance, or you can even just have an open-air performance, or for intermissions.
The balconies all move to go between those configurations, but they also disappear.
The proscenium line can also disappear.
You can bring enormous objects in, so in fact their -- the Dallas Theater Company -- their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh, and they'll want to bring in [a] real aircraft.
And then it also provides them, in the off-season, the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.
This is it at night -- sorry, from a distance.
Open up entire portions for different kinds of events.
And at night.
Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.
This is a monster truck show.
I'm going to show now the last project.
This also is an unusual client.
They inverted the whole idea of development.
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said, "We want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville. That's our main goal."
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money, they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.
And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum actually built their pro forma, so they worked in reverse.
And that pro forma led us to a mixed-use building that was very large in order to support their aspirations of the art, but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces that actually artists more and more want to work within.
And it also charged us with thinking about how to have something that was both a single building and a credible sort of sub-building.
So now I'm going to -- this is Louisville's skyline -- and I'm going to take you through various constraints that led to the project.
First: the physical constraints. We actually had to operate on three discrete sites, all of them well, well smaller than the size of the building.
We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali center, and respect it.
We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.
Now, this area floods three to four times a year, and there's a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.
Have to operate behind the I-64 corridor, a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.
So these -- we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.
Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings, and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district -- that they didn't want to obstruct with the new building.
And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.
And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet -- these are the different programs -- the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites, and now we'd have a really terrible situation: a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.
And then we would size all the other elements -- the different commercial elements: hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth -- and dump it on top. And we would create something that was unviable.
In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner building.
So our strategy was very simple.
Just lift the entire block, flip some of the elements over, reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown, and make circulation connections and reroute the road.
So that's the basic concept, and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.
OK, it seems a very formal, willful gesture, but something derived entirely out of the constraints.
And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness that this was about an architect making a statement, not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.
Now, within that center zone, as I said, we have the ability to mix a series of things.
So here you can see that these -- this -- sort of an x-ray -- the towers are totally developer-driven. They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth and we focused on taking all the public components -- the lobbies, the bars, everything that the different commercial elements would have -- and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map, in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.
So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor, but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.
It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen or to see the art, and so forth.
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool, they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool, so they're not forced to always work within the confines of a contemporary gallery space.
So, how to build this.
It's very simple: it's a chair.
So, we begin by building the cores.
As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.
That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.
This is not a high-budget building.
The moment the cores get to mid level, we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it; and then we jack it up into the air.
This is how they build really large aircraft hangars, for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.
Finish the cores, finish the meat and you get something that looks like this.
Now I only have about 30 seconds, so I want to start an animation, and we'll conclude with that. Thank you.
Chris asked me to add -- the theater is under construction, and this project will start construction in about a year, and finish in 2010.
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit, so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point where I get this thing to work.
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together, and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging.
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong, namely, by actually doing something about it.
I'm going to do that in two steps.
The first one I'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed, to get sick in the first place.
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step, that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
So I'm going to start with why we should.
Now, I want to ask a question.
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
That was easy. OK.
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
And here is that characteristic.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially, to talk about the comparison with foxhunting, which is something that was banned after a long struggle, by the government not very many months ago.
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here, but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know, city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
It's a traditional part of the way of life, and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course -- -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
It's a global trance.
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging.
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless.
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong, then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
Now, there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
People worry about overpopulation; they say, "Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of, or at least the death toll is going to be much lower, only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids, and kids are really important to most people."
And that's true.
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question, and give answers like this.
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate, or a high death rate.
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies, in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
And, I say that that's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
If we vacillate, hesitate, and do not actually develop these therapies, then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies, but will not be, because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could -- we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span, and I consider that that is immoral.
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all.
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem.
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot -- in order to get people's attention, and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard.
So that's all I'm going to say about that.
I'm now going to talk about feasibility.
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
A very simple definition.
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place, which is to say, metabolism.
This is not a completely tautological statement; it's a reasonable statement.
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars, and it also happens to us, despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms, because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
So basically, metabolism, which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next, has side effects.
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way: we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
And there are really two games in town, according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day, when pathology is becoming evident, and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time, and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon.
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle, because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface, because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we're not really too good on yet.
We've discovered things like, for example, RNA interference only a few years ago, and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end, but it is not an approach whose time has come when we're talking about intervention.
So then, what do we do about that?
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing, pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
But it isn't.
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit into what I'm calling step two.
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies, then they'll live 30 years longer."
That's the wrong answer.
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
There are two sorts of technological progress really, for this purpose.
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs, and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
Now, they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames.
Fundamental breakthroughs: very hard to predict how long it's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough.
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun, and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore.
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line, happening of course a bit later.
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics -- you know, the same sort of time frame.
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago, isn't a step at all.
That in fact, the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension, even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive, will be at some sort of cusp.
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
This is a very important point for me to get across.
Because, you know, most people, when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more, they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough.
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
I decided to give this a little name, which is "longevity escape velocity."
Well, it seems to get the point across.
So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live, in terms of remaining life expectancy, as measured by their health, for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 -- and an average 80-year-old, we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies, because you're too close to death's door for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
You won't be able to withstand them.
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense, in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental, and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that, then you're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old -- we don't know how old that person is today, because we don't know how long it's going to take to get these first-generation therapies.
But irrespective of that age, I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes -- is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
And that's quite a thought.
Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk, my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one; namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
And this is what it is.
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse, which basically means mice that live about three years on average.
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them, and with those therapies, we get them to live, on average, to their fifth birthday.
So, in other words, we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan, starting from the point that we started the therapies.
The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.
One has to be very speculative, and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation, that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
I say that's nonsense.
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame, in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities.
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone, robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
15 years from the robust mouse.
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
So they'll probably think it's five years away.
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes, and of course that has enormous implications.
So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice, I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
I'm going to use this word "damage" to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology.
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology, the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
But it is not part of metabolism itself.
And this turns out to be useful.
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage.
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
It does not intervene in this process or this one.
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle, and it's something that we are within range of being able to do, because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
The engineering approach simply says, "Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot, so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."
We know that this threshold exists, because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age, even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
The list on the right is also incomplete.
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related, and it's just an incomplete list.
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage, side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end, or that might cause pathology.
And there are only seven of them.
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
Of course one can make a biological argument.
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.
What can damage accumulate in?
The answer is: long-lived molecules, because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.
It's got to be long-lived molecules.
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news, because it means that, you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years, so the fact that we haven't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all, in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is, we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
I haven't got time to go through them at all, but my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this, then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years, but we do need to get serious about it.
We do need to really start trying.
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience, and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk, but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
I've published a great deal on this; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based, and there's quite a lot of detail there.
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
So if you think that I'm wrong, you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because, as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field, you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously.
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework, in order to understand whether this is true.
And we'll just end with a few things.
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time, and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."
And you know what happened.
So, you know, this does happen.
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize, which is basically an incentive to innovate, and to do what you think is going to work, and you get money for it if you win.
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
This is what's going to take a bit of money.
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
Not very long. OK.
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech, but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
Thank you.
OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance.
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it, why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question, which I happen to agree with, which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution; [aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging; you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly, and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter, doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals, living a long time or by procreation, there's a certain amount of modulation of that, which is why different species have different lifespans, but that's why there are no immortal species.
The genes don't care but we do?
AG: That's right.
Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years, the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
If I project that, that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
AG: If you lose a bit of weight.
Your numbers are a bit out.
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo, and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
If that is indeed true, biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years, as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
AG: There are technical implications certainly.
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate, especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway, because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification.
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells.
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole.
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday.
I remember standing on the edge of the ice, about to dive into the water, and thinking to myself, I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening.
The water is completely black.
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade, or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's flipping freezing in that water.
And then a thought came across my mind: if things go pear-shaped on this swim, how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean?
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water.
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst.
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following: I'm never, ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again.
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change.
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier.
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake.
And I firmly believe that what we're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great, big battleground on this earth.
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas.
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is, and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much, I think we have a real risk of instability.
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, all these countries.
And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest, the highest mountain on this earth, and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest.
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest, but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.
28 great, big, powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don't just have my Speedo, but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world.
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
So it's right up in the heavens.
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time.
That's not the worst part of it.
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest, and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain.
And when you're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you're trying to do that, and then the bodies are coming past you, it humbles you, and you also realize very, very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are.
And we walked up this pathway, all the way up.
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier.
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice.
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest, and I prepared myself the same way as I've always prepared myself, for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music, I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water.
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters, and then I realized very, very quickly, I had a huge problem on my hands.
I could barely breathe.
I was gasping for air.
I then began to choke, and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
And it all happened so quickly: I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.
And luckily, the water was quite shallow, and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air.
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
I carried on for another five or six strokes, and then I had nothing in my body, and I went down to the bottom of the lake.
And I don't where I got it from, but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake.
I've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have.
I have never, ever heard such utter bollocks.
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have.
I got myself to the side of the lake.
My crew grabbed me, and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp.
And there, we sat down, and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest.
And my team just gave it to me straight.
They said, Lewis, you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim.
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming, you must forget.
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army, about speed and aggression, you put that to one side.
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
Take some time to rest and think about things.
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time, and instead of swimming fast, swim as slowly as possible.
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.
This is the time to swim with real humility.
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later.
And I stood there on the edge of the lake, and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself, just do this slowly.
And I swam across the lake.
And I can't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side.
But I learned two very, very important lessons there on Mt. Everest, and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well, doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
And similarly, now, before I do anything, I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task.
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is, frankly, the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long, just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long, doesn't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on.
The warning signs are all there.
When I was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion people.
We're now 6.8 billion people, and we're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050.
And then the second lesson, the radical, tactical shift.
And I've come here to ask you today: what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment, which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world, and most importantly, in a sustainable world?
And I ask you, please, to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make, which will make that big difference, and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it, and commit a hundred percent, because very, very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it.
So thank you very, very much.
Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design, and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.
But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs, so I pretty much know everything there is.
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky.
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls.
Ah yes, a table.
We use these every day.
And on top of it, the juicy salif.
This is a design by Philippe Starck, who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.
And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision, its playfulness, its innovation and its promise of imminent violence.
It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it.
It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time, which would be useful out in the lobby, I would say.
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts.
It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that, you never see it as anything else again.
It is also not a monument to design, it is a monument to design's utility.
You can take it home with you, unlike the Theme Building, which will stay where it is forever.
This is affordable and can come home with you and, as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can't go in your drawers; trust me, I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design.
One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know: when you fall asleep, it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep.
Okay, what is this object?
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.
It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?
I don't get it.
Does anyone know? Chi?
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those; I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days.
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
Here is my well-loved iPhone.
I do so many things on this little device.
I like to read books on it.
More than that, I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect.
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox, for example.
Every now and then, I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally.
And yet I forget about it all the time.
This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it.
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
And unlike the juicy salif, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain, rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain.
And you didn't even notice it happened.
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.
I just explained design.
Thank you very much.
So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
That's what I want to talk about.
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.
But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.
So what do I plan to leave for my son?
I collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up.
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."
Thank you.
I've always written primarily about architecture, about buildings, and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions.
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place, or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places, at the end of the day, you can go and you can visit them. You can walk around them.
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
You can experience their sense of place.
But what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was I going out into the world, and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.
And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone, I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day, but I was also getting up at the end of the day and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
And what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed.
In this very short period of time, you know, whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last, you know, four or five years of being online all the time, our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided. You know, we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking out in the world around us.
And what was even more striking to me, and what I really got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own.
If you went and looked for images of the Internet, this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth, the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest, I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.
We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.
So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them together in the same place.
And then this happened.
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does, and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch, and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard, and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."
And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.
But that in fact seemed to be the case.
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.
And then I got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it. Where would it go?
Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
Could I go there? Who would I meet?
You know, was there something actually out there?
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it, as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for.
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it.
It wasn't a real world out there.
But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there, and that's what I spent about two years visiting, these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit, and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York, which is one of the buildings in the world, one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings, where more networks of the Internet connect to each other than anywhere else.
And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is, connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into the ceiling and down into the router of another network, and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others, has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings.
There's a very short list of these places.
And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home to about a half a dozen very important networks, which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath the ocean, cables like this.
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive, as expansive as you can imagine.
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length, and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other, and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood, and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams, but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.
And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.
They connect in a manhole like this. Literally, this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable, they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it, they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks, you have to send a ship out into the water, throw a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end, and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.
So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.
And I've never met him. We've only communicated via this telepresence system, which always makes me think of him as the man inside the Internet.
And he is English. The undersea cable industry is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.
Because they all started at the same time with the boom about 20 years ago.
And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces onto them, until they had built a belt around the world, which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world, and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around the other direction. And then having done that, they started to look for places to wire next.
They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.
But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.
He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.
And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time online we experience these fleeting moments of connection, these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.
It seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.
And Simon was working on a new cable, WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa, to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
And he said there was coming soon, depending on the weather, but he'd let me know when, and so with about four days notice, he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9, this guy will walk out of the water.
And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line, called a messenger line, and that was the first link between sea and land, this link that would then be leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off, and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out to the ship, and when he got there, they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie, and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore, and then he lit a cigarette.
And then once that cable was on shore, they began to prepare to connect it to the other side, for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a -- sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down, and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
And what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.
You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer giving directions in the background. And more importantly, the places are the same. These cables still connect these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa, Mumbai, Singapore, New York.
And then the process on shore takes around three or four days, and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover back on top, and they push the sand over that, and we all forget about it.
And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud, but every time we put something on the cloud, we give up some responsibility for it.
We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.
And that doesn't seem right.
There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires.
And we should know, I think, we should know where our Internet comes from, and we should know what it is that physically, physically connects us all.
Thank you.
Thanks.
A human child is born, and for quite a long time is a consumer.
It cannot be consciously a contributor.
It is helpless.
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
It has to totally surrender, as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
It has to totally surrender.
That implies a lot of trust.
That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust.
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor.
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough.
To be compassionate is not a joke.
It's not that simple.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself.
The self: you are self-aware.
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion.
Thank God we are empathetic.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
In a Wimbledon final match, these two guys fight it out.
Each one has got two games.
It can be anybody's game.
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.
One person wins.
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net and shake hands.
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
And this guy has to come to the net.
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes.
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
Why? Empathy.
That's human heart.
No human heart is denied of that empathy.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy.
And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people, you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life -- even words, even time.
Compassion is not defined in one form.
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional.
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
You can't say, "Please love me."
Love is something you discover.
It's not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action.
I will come to it later.
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience.
In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things.
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself.
The subject -- "me" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of," an experience common to all and sundry.
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards and layoffs and, finally, baldness -- you can be happy.
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you.
It has got to be you.
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole.
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: "Maybe I am the whole.
Maybe the swami is right.
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
Compassion is going to be limited.
Everything is going to be limitless.
You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not. Period.
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world.
It is love first.
When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love.
And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
You express yourself because you have compassion.
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing.
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
You learn swimming by swimming.
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook.
And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it.
You need to.
My predecessor meant that.
You have to act it out.
You have to act compassionately.
There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion.
That's interesting to me.
You act compassionately.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
You fake it and make it.
You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system.
If you know how to pray, pray.
Ask for compassion.
Let me act compassionately.
Do it.
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are.
With these words, thank you very much.
The Kraken, a beast so terrifying it was said to devour men and ships and whales, and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
In assessing the merits of such tales, it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story is a fairytale begins, "Once upon a time," and a sea story begins, "This ain't no shit."
Every fish that gets away grows with every telling of the tale.
Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean, and we now have video proof, as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
I was one of the three scientists on this expedition that took place last summer off Japan.
I'm the short one.
The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
I owe my participation in this now-historic event to TED.
In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean, one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
Mike deGruy was also invited, and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean, and he also talked to me about applying my approach to something he's been involved with for a very long time, which is the hunt for the giant squid.
It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit, a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel that summer during Shark Week.
I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing and optical luring of deep sea squid in which I emphasized the importance of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
This came out of hundreds of dives I have made, farting around in the dark using these platforms, and my impression that I saw more animals working from the submersible than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
But I also felt like I saw more animals working with the Tiburon than the Ventana, two vehicles with the same field of view but different propulsion systems.
So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean, and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance and recorded the sound they made.
The Johnson Sea-Link -- -- which you can probably just barely hear here, uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.
The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.
But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.
I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish, but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape, and a common form of defense in the deep sea.
The approach worked.
Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant, we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
Edith Widder : Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance -- now you see me, now you don't -- and we had four such teasing appearances, and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
EW: The full monty.
What really wowed me about that was the way it came in up over the e-jelly and then attacked the enormous thing next to it, which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
But even more incredible was the footage shot from the Triton submersible.
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in.
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house.
How could something that big live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
There are great discoveries yet to be made down there, fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction of the money on ocean exploration that we've spent on space exploration.
We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration, because we need to be exploring and protecting our life support systems here on Earth.
We need — thank you.
Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
Innovation drives economic growth.
So let's all go exploring, but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away, or, as Mike deGruy once said, "If you want to get away from it all and see something you've never seen, or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen, get in a sub."
He should have been with us for this adventure.
We miss him.
Okay, it's great to be back at TED.
Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?
Okay, Glass, record a video.
This is it. We're on in two minutes.
Okay Glass, hang out with The Flying Club.
Google "photos of tiger heads." Hmm.
You ready? You ready?
Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture.
Go!
Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome.
Whoa! Look at that snake!
Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video!
Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.
Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!
Man 9: Google, say "delicious" in Thai.
Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย.
Woman 4: Google "jellyfish."
Man 10: It's beautiful.
Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.
He needs help getting 10 million dollars.
I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company, and it's gone pretty well.
Though in all seriousness, this position that you just saw me in, looking down at my phone, that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information.
Should it be by just walking around looking down?
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor.
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it.
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone, it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?
You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass.
You're just kind of moving around.
So when we developed Glass, we thought really about, can we make something that frees your hands?
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there.
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage.
And also you want something that frees your eyes.
That's why we put the display up high, out of your line of sight, so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people.
And also we wanted to free up the ears, so the sound actually goes through, conducts straight to the bones in your cranium, which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.
And ironically, if you want to hear it better, you actually just cover your ear, which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all.
You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
And this is now, 15 years later, sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth.
This project has lasted now, been just over two years.
We've learned an amazing amount.
It's been really important to make it comfortable.
So our first prototypes we built were huge.
It was like cell phones strapped to your head.
It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job, and then she almost ran away screaming.
But we've come a long way.
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all, but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family, my kids.
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment.
And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device, that I also kind of have a nervous tic.
The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that, but it's also kind of a nervous habit.
Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.
I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.
You know, I'd be like -- But in this case, you know, I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to.
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away, be it email or social posts or whatnot, even though it wasn't really -- there's nothing really that important or that pressing.
And with this, I know I will get certain messages if I really need them, but I don't have to be checking them all the time.
Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more, doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.
Thank you all very much.
Hello voicemail, my old friend.
I've called for tech support again.
I ignored my boss' warning. I called on a Monday morning.
Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew mold.
I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence.
I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned.
I punched every touch tone I was told, but I still spent 18 hours on hold.
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMS! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys.
Say your motorcycle crashes.
Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.
And you listen to the sounds of silence.
Thank you. Good evening and welcome to "Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist."
OK. When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets.
Every week it'll arrive at your door.
You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back.
And you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want.
I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.
The job, though, came with one small downside. And that is: they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.
If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
People are feeling like things -- OK, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it.
People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology too fast.
It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.
There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use.
One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, "Me too!" and, "Here's my tale of woe." I call it "software rage."
And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.
OK, so why is the problem accelerating? Part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.
I'll show you what I mean.
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
Over the years it's gotten easier to use.
This is the original Mac operating system.
Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.
And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211k.
You couldn't put the Mac OS 10 logo in 211k!
So the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.
I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day.
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.
And the calls that -- you know how they say, "Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"
Mm-Mmm. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.
Which they do.
And I have a copy.
It's in your TEDGift Bag. No, no.
With your voices on it!
Some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.
A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking -- making a squeaking noise.
And the technician said, "Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?"
She says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster I move it across the screen."
And the technician's like, "Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'" Well, if you like that one, how much time have we got?
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true! -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it no matter how many times he typed 11.
And the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?" He said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'" So we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.
But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.
So it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions.
When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.
It's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year.
And every year, they say, "We've added more features and we'll sell it to you for $99."
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.
I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.
But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, "Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features.
Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor.
Simple, pure, does not do web pages, is not a database."
And it came out. It was called Microsoft Write.
And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died.
It tanked. No one ever bought it.
I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, "Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?
Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.
You can do buttons; you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.
This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.
You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complained about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically.
The off switch is in there somewhere.
I'm telling you, it's there!
Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features.
Here is the log off dialogue box for Windows 2000.
There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu?
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices.
They could have put them all out in view.
Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.
Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no, no.
Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design.
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
There are these "wizards" everywhere.
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.
"Welcome to the Type-A-Word Wizard." OK, I'll bite. Let's click "Next" to continue.
From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. OK.
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer?
How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?
I believe in consistency with possible, real-world equivalents, trashcan folder when possible, label things mostly.
But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that?
I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address and you're supposed to choose which country you're from, OK?
There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village.
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
It's mainly, like, the United States, Europe and Japan.
So why is United States in the "U"s?
You have to scroll, like, seven screens-full to get to it.
Now it would be inconsistent to put United States first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called "Start?"
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.
Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer.
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."
Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity.
Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.
I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees.
He says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you, what do you do here?"
He said, "I'm a tap counter."
I'm like, "You're a what?" He goes, "Well, Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter."
I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.
This is Microsoft Word. When you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen!
-- you go up to the File menu and you choose "New." Now, what happens when you choose "New?" Do you get a new blank document?
You do not.
On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.
That is a company not counting taps.
You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...
Audience: Go on.
David Pogue: Yes, I do.
The Bill Gates song!
I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS.
I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.
I write the code that makes the whole world run.
I'm gettin' royalties from everyone.
Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.
You buy the box; I'll sell the code.
Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&amp;D.
You can't keep a good idea down these days.
Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise.
I write the code that fits the world today.
Big mediocrity in every way.
We've entered planet domination mode.
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
I am Bill Gates and I write the code.
But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.
There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis.
But there's also a new Microsoft that's really doing good, simple interface designs.
I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.
Let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night, like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?
The signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.
So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller.
People are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes.
The things are coming out at a faster pace.
It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie "Evita" -- -- with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what, I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.
When I try to explain why I'm back after telling the press Apple's future is black.
You won't believe me.
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.
You try rhyming with garage!
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.
The truth is, I never left you.
I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.
I made a fortune over at Pixar.
Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision.
I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.
Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed -- because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share and Windows had 95 percent market share.
People did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
So I was a little depressed -- then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.
But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom.
Other products cost less. Other products had more features.
They had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
The other products were backed by Microsoft with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard.
But the iPod won! This is the one they wanted.
The lesson was: simplicity sells.
And there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.
The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.
I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant, thinking coming along lately.
When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?
Well, you either haul around a USB cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around.
Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything.
Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power.
Will you be my power plug?
Oh yeah.
DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might have seen this: this is Apple's new laptop. This is the power cord. It hooks on like this.
And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner.
Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic. It doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software, and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous.
"Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly. Period.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day. Period.
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down. Period.
I also use this feature called voice macros. Period."
Correct "dissuade". "Not just."
Okay, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
But the point is: I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, "Thanks for that."
And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, "Piss off."
So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.
So the point is, this a really interesting story.
This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight?
No new features. It's never happened before in software!
The company put no new features. They just said, "We'll make the software work right." Right.
Because for years people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything but make sure it's darned accurate."
And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread.
My final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work it's not necessarily you, OK?
It could be the design of the thing you're using.
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.
And if you're among the people who create the stuff, easy is hard.
Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.
Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add -- it's deciding what to leave out.
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
Bravo.
DP: Thank you very much.
Hear, hear!
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities, which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa, education is just not readily accessible.
In South Africa, the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year at the University of Johannesburg.
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
When the gates opened, there was a stampede, and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available, it might not be within reach.
There has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care.
What might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate, for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
This makes education unaffordable for many people.
Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education, the doors of opportunity might not open.
Only a little over half of recent college graduates in the United States who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education.
This, of course, is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions, but for many others, they do not get the value for their time and their effort.
Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article, captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
He said the big breakthroughs are what happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big Stanford classes, each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes, the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder Andrew Ng.
Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
It's a Machine Learning class, and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public, it had 100,000 people registered.
So to put that number in perspective, for Andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a Stanford class, he would have to do that for 250 years.
Of course, he'd get really bored.
So, having seen the impact of this, Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up, to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
So we formed Coursera, whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
We currently have 43 courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines, and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like.
Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
We get unbelievable segregation.
Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future, you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
It turns out, maybe not surprisingly, that students like getting the best content from the best universities for free.
Since we opened the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
We have 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.
Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
Or Ryan, who can't go to school, because his immune deficient daughter can't be risked to have germs come into the house, so he couldn't leave the house.
I'm really glad to say -- recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan -- that this story had a happy ending.
Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left -- is doing much better now, and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
So what made these courses so different?
After all, online course content has been available for a while.
What made it different was that this was real course experience.
It started on a given day, and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments.
And these would be real homework assignments for a real grade, with a real deadline.
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
These are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon.
At the end of the course, the students got a certificate.
They could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job, and we know many students who did.
Some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit.
So these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time and effort.
Let's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses.
The first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format, you can break away from, for example, the monolithic one-hour lecture.
You can break up the material, for example, into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes, each of which represents a coherent concept.
Students can traverse this material in different ways, depending on their background, their skills or their interests.
So, for example, some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
So this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education, and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it.
There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
This one that appeared in Science last year, for example, demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice, where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions.
We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform, as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
For example, even our videos are not just videos.
Every few minutes, the video pauses and the students get asked a question.
SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
So here the video pauses, and the student types in the answer into the box and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
So they get to try again, and this time they got it right.
There's an optional explanation if they want.
And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
This is a kind of simple question that I as an instructor might ask in class, but when I ask that kind of a question in class, 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing I said, 15 percent are zoned out on Facebook, and then there's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it, and I as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer.
And so the lecture moves on before, really, most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
Here, every single student has to engage with the material.
And of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story.
One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions, and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions.
Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
The answer is, you need to use technology to do it for you.
Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way, and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
In addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video, we can also grade math, mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations.
We can grade models, whether it's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple but fairly visual.
This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class, and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image.
They're typing their program into the browser, and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that, and they can move on to the next assignment.
This ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you're right or wrong is really essential to student learning.
Now, of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses.
Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
So we tried to convince, for example, some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
That didn't go over really well.
So we had to come up with a different solution.
And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
It turns out that previous studies show, like this one by Saddler and Good, that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades.
It was tried only in small classes, but there it showed, for example, that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
What's even more surprising is that self-grades, where the students grade their own work critically -- so long as you incentivize them properly so they can't give themselves a perfect score -- are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
And so this is an effective strategy that can be used for grading at scale, and is also a useful learning strategy for the students, because they actually learn from the experience.
So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised, where tens of thousands of students are grading each other's work, and quite successfully, I have to say.
But this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems.
Around each one of our courses, a community of students had formed, a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor.
What you see here is a self-generated map from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course, where they have put themselves on a world map, and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
First of all, there was a question and answer forum, where students would pose questions, and other students would answer those questions.
And the really amazing thing is, because there were so many students, it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning, somewhere around the world, there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem.
And so, in many of our courses, the median response time for a question on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
And you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community, they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
Students also self-assembled, without any kind of intervention from us, into small study groups.
Some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
This is the San Francisco study group, but there were ones all over the world.
Others were virtual study groups, sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines, and on the bottom left there, you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures.
There are some tremendous opportunities to be had from this kind of framework.
The first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning.
Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
You can collect every click, every homework submission, every forum post from tens of thousands of students.
So you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode, a transformation that, for example, has revolutionized biology.
You can use these data to understand fundamental questions like, what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not?
And in the context of particular courses, you can ask questions like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them?
So here's an example of that, also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
This is a distribution of wrong answers to one of Andrew's assignments.
The answers happen to be pairs of numbers, so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
The big cross at the top left is where 2,000 students gave the exact same wrong answer.
Now, if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer, you would never notice.
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss.
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.
Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984, posed what's called the 2 sigma problem, which he observed by studying three populations.
The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
The second is a population of students that studied using a standard lecture-based classroom, but with a mastery-based approach, so the students couldn't move on to the next topic before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
And finally, there was a population of students that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation, or sigma, in achievement scores better than the standard lecture-based class, and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma improvement in performance.
To understand what that means, let's look at the lecture-based classroom, and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
So in a lecture-based class, half the students are above that level and half are below.
In the individual tutoring instruction, 98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average.
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
Because we cannot afford, as a society, to provide every student with an individual human tutor.
But maybe we can afford to provide each student with a computer or a smartphone.
So the question is, how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve, to the right side with the green curve?
Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer, because a computer doesn't get tired of showing you the same video five times.
And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times, we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
And even personalization is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of, whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
So the goal here is to try and push, and see how far we can get towards the green curve.
So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
He said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes go straight to the students' lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either."
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
I think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on.
So let's go back even further, to Plutarch, who said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."
And maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our students' minds with content by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity, their imagination and their problem-solving skills by actually talking with them.
So how do we do that?
We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
So there's been many studies, including this one, that show that if you use active learning, interacting with your students in the classroom, performance improves on every single metric -- on attendance, on engagement and on learning as measured by a standardized test.
You can see, for example, that the achievement score almost doubles in this particular experiment.
So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free, what would that do? Three things.
First it would establish education as a fundamental human right, where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves, their families and their communities.
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
It's a shame that for so many people, learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
By having this amazing content be available, we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted, whether it's just to expand our minds or it's to change our lives.
And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation, because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
And if we could offer that person an education, they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk.
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life.
And I actually didn't leave my house for about three days.
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch.
And when I walked in, she was already at the table.
And I sat down, and she said, "God, you look like hell."
I said, "Thanks. I feel really -- I'm not functioning."
And she said, "What's going on?"
And I said, "I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability.
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data, as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living, I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown.
I had a slide that said Breakdown.
At what point did I think that was a good idea?"
And she said, "I saw your Talk live-streamed.
It was not really you.
It was a little different than what you usually do.
But it was great."
And I said, "This can't happen.
YouTube, they're putting this thing on YouTube.
And we're going to be talking about 600, 700 people."
And she said, "Well, I think it's too late."
And I said, "Let me ask you something."
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb?"
And she said, "Yeah."
And I said, "Remember when we'd leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
Then we'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape?"
And she goes, "Uh ... no."
So of course, the only thing I could think of to say at that point was, "Yeah, me neither.
That ... me neither."
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brene, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Why did you bring this up? Have you lost your mind?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?"
And I said, "I'm just thinking about it a little bit."
She said, "You're like the worst vulnerability role model ever."
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic, but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic.
I said, "If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000, my life is over."
I had no contingency plan for four million.
And my life did end when that happened.
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself, and that was that, as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world, there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small, staying right under the radar.
But I want to talk about what I've learned.
There's two things that I've learned in the last year.
The first is vulnerability is not weakness.
And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
Let me ask you honestly -- and I'll give you this warning, I'm trained as a therapist, so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly, when you're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable, think, "God, vulnerability's weakness. This is weakness?"
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously?
The majority of people.
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
It fuels our daily lives.
And I've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable, to let ourselves be seen, to be honest.
One of the weird things that's happened is, after the TED explosion, I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies.
And so many of the calls went like this, "Hey, Dr. Brown. We loved your TEDTalk.
We'd like you to come in and speak.
We'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention vulnerability or shame."
What would you like for me to talk about?
There's three big answers.
This is mostly, to be honest with you, from the business sector: innovation, creativity and change.
So let me go on the record and say, vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.
To create is to make something that has never existed before.
There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability.
The second thing, in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage, the second thing I learned is this: We have to talk about shame.
And I'm going to be really honest with you.
When I became a "vulnerability researcher" and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I'm not kidding.
I'll give you an example.
About three months ago, I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store.
About from a hundred feet away, this is what I hear: "Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"
I'm a fifth generation Texan.
Our family motto is "Lock and load."
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher.
So I'm like, just keep walking, she's on my six.
And then I hear, "Vulnerability TED!"
I turn around, I go, "Hi."
She's right here and she said, "You're the shame researcher who had the breakdown."
At this point parents are, like, pulling their children close.
"Look away."
And I'm so worn out at this point in my life, I look at her and I actually say, "It was a frickin' spiritual awakening."
And she looks back and does this, "I know."
And she said, "We watched your TEDTalk in my book club.
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves 'The Breakdown Babes.'" And she said, "Our tagline is: 'We're falling apart and it feels fantastic.'" You can only imagine what it's like for me in a faculty meeting.
So when I became Vulnerability TED, like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie, but I'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought, I'm going to leave that shame stuff behind, because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability.
And I thought, thank God, because shame is this horrible topic, no one wants to talk about it.
It's the best way to shut people down on an airplane.
"What do you do?" "I study shame." "Oh."
And I see you.
But in surviving this last year, I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule, but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you've got to dance with the one who brung ya.
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability.
I learned about these things from studying shame.
And so I want to walk you in to shame.
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul.
And we're going to walk in.
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there.
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around.
Here's why.
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country, and I think globally, around race, right?
Yes? We heard that.
Yes?
Cannot have that conversation without shame, because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege.
And when people start talking about privilege, they get paralyzed by shame.
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery, which is have a checklist.
You can't fix that problem without addressing shame, because when they teach those folks how to suture, they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful.
And all-powerful folks don't need checklists.
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn't mess it up here.
Myshkin Ingawale, I hope I did right by you.
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily.
And he said, "I saw this need.
So you know what I did? I made it."
And everybody just burst into applause, and they were like "Yes!"
And he said, "And it didn't work.
And then I made it 32 more times, and then it worked."
You know what the big secret about TED is?
I can't wait to tell people this.
I guess I'm doing it right now.
This is like the failure conference.
No, it is.
You know why this place is amazing?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail.
And no one who gets on the stage, so far that I've seen, has not failed.
I've failed miserably, many times.
I don't think the world understands that because of shame.
There's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt.
A lot of people refer to it as the "Man in the Arena" quote.
And it goes like this: "It is not the critic who counts.
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles.
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat.
But when he's in the arena, at best he wins, and at worst he loses, but when he fails, when he loses, he does so daring greatly."
And that's what this conference, to me, is about.
That's what life is about, about daring greatly, about being in the arena.
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door, and you think, "I'm going in and I'm going to try this," shame is the gremlin who says, "Uh, uh.
You're not good enough.
You never finished that MBA. Your wife left you.
I know your dad really wasn't in Luxembourg, he was in Sing Sing.
I know those things that happened to you growing up.
I know you don't think that you're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough.
I know your dad never paid attention, even when you made CFO."
Shame is that thing.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"
The thing to understand about shame is it's not guilt.
Shame is a focus on self, guilt is a focus on behavior.
Shame is "I am bad."
Guilt is "I did something bad."
How many of you, if you did something that was hurtful to me, would be willing to say, "I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"
How many of you would be willing to say that?
Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
There's a huge difference between shame and guilt.
And here's what you need to know.
Shame is highly, highly correlated with addiction, depression, violence, aggression, bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
And here's what you even need to know more.
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris, it's going to feel the same.
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
For women, the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial: "I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."
For women, shame is do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
Shame, for women, is this web of unobtainable, conflicting, competing expectations about who we're supposed to be.
And it's a straight-jacket.
For men, shame is not a bunch of competing, conflicting expectations.
Shame is one, do not be perceived as what?
Weak.
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study.
And it wasn't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing, said, "I love what you have to say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men."
And I said, "I don't study men."
And he said, "That's convenient."
And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"
I said, "Yeah."
"They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down.
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us.
And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads, because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else."
So I started interviewing men and asking questions.
And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher," but he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
And to get out from underneath it, to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
Very quickly, some research by Mahalik at Boston College.
He asked, what do women need to do to conform to female norms?
The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
The two most powerful words when we're in struggle: me too.
And so I'll leave you with this thought.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, vulnerability is going to be that path.
And I know it's seductive to stand outside the arena, because I think I did it my whole life, and think to myself, I'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
And that is seductive.
But the truth is that never happens.
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there, that's not what we want to see.
We want you to go in.
We want to be with you and across from you.
And we just want, for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with, to dare greatly.
So thank you all very much. I really appreciate it.
In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti, my former professor of art history, and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci, the "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so I decided, with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo.
Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking, because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling, and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494, and to find out the original doors, windows, and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model, and then, with thermography, we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore, all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari, and restructured the whole thing, including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari" on a specific area of one of the two walls.
Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family, we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap.
One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence, so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo, since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall, an air gap, and that's where we believe "The Battle of Anghiari," or at least the part that we know has been painted, which is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.
Well, from there, unfortunately, in 2004, the project came to a halt. Many political reasons.
So I decided to go back to my alma mater, and, at the University of California, San Diego, and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in, and we started to build technologies, because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork.
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011, and this time, with a great group of students, and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester, who is now the director at CISA3, and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left.
Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say, for several reasons that it's not worth explaining, to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had, and with a 4mm camera attached to it, we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color, black color, and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams, XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well, those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo.
Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind.
As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had, and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named the number one artist influence at the time.
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me, but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example, the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another, different lady, aged lady, I should rather say.
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches, and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
And — — no problem, but, unfortunately, continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn, did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — — unfortunately, is not very reliable.
Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution, let me add. Take this example: Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life" at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through, and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location.
So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good, and so, again, authenticity and science could go together and change the way, not attributions being made, but at least lay the ground for a more objective, or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution, as it is done today.
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer, brown layer, of "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it, and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath.
Well, this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits.
They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
You see the geniality of his creation, right directly on the ground layer of the panel, and see this cool thing, finding, I should rather say, an elephant. Because of this elephant, over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.
This was an epiphany. We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.
Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have this pleasure, this privilege to see all this, to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing, any of us could be doing, in a museum environment.
So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.
Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause, and now let me turn to you so the moment the image, or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting, then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so, see.
We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.
Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.
So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.
Okay? And then if we want, we can continue the scroll to find out, for example, on the staircase, the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple, and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?
This is not just a curiosity, because it changes not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology, the meaning of the painting, and we believe this is a cool way, easy way, that everybody could have access to, to become more the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums.
Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients, but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately, it's never been tapped as an idea.
Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning, the very first step, to do real conservation, and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation, the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting.
Well, our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.
We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values, these cultural values that we badly need, especially today.
And if you want to summarize in one just single word, well, this is what we're trying to do.
We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future.
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion, there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you.
In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life.
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.
I took a couple victory laps in there.
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains.
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time.
This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
Now fast forward to just three years ago.
And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries.
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home.
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, "Water Night," another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.
Could we do this all in real time?
Could we have people singing together in real time?
And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today.
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and — -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
We deal in milliseconds.
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.
So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present "Cloudburst."
[The rain ...] [Eyes of shadow-water] [eyes of well-water] [eyes of dream-water.] [Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.] [But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?] [Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?] [The rain awakens...] [We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.] [We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.] [We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...] ["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.
Thank you.
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise, admiration and thank you, and having it be specific and genuine.
And the way I got interested in this was, I noticed in myself, when I was growing up, and until about a few years ago, that I would want to say thank you to someone, I would want to praise them, I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it.
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
And then my question became, am I the only one who does this?
So, I decided to investigate.
I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility, so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as, their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
But then, they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him, but he never told the son.
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
So my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years, who's longing to hear his wife say, "Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids," but won't ask.
I know a woman who's good at this.
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says, "I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
And praise really does have to be genuine, but she takes responsibility for that.
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten, she thanks her children for doing their chores.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare, I need size six shoes," but I won't say, "Would you praise me this way?"
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
And I'm treating you, my inner circle, like you're the enemy.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels, it's going to make the bike so much better."
I get the same bike back, and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I want you to true your wheels: be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife -- go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
And it's simple.
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands, great mothers, friends, daughters, sons.
And maybe somebody's never said that to you, but you've done a really, really good job.
And thank you for being here, just showing up and changing the world with your ideas.
Thank you.

It's a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe, which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe.
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.
[The Himalayas.] The flat horizon that we've evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite: unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste.
It wasn't until we really left Earth, got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself, that we could understand our planet as a limited condition.
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years.
We maintain that, put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales.
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe, as we see.
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world.
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome.
But what you see here is the result of, actually, internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden.
I've had 12 students work on this for their graduate work, and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden.
This software allows interactive use, so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live.
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live, and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology.
And so as we move out, we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here, light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.
As we move out, the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long, we're essentially backing up into the past.
We back so far up we're finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the Big Bang.
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see.
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.
If we were outside this, it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
But this our containment of the visible universe.
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
Coming in closer, picking up Earth, orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.
This map can be updated, and we can add in new data.
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission.
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases, ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan, which is larger that the planet Mercury, diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this.
This software can also be networked between domes.
We have a growing user base of this, and we network domes.
And we can network between domes and classrooms.
We're actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia.
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.
This is an image from Saturday, photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.
This is Nepal.
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa, right here in Tibet.
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India.
This is Nepal and Tibet.
And just in closing, I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow that some of you may have had to brave in coming out -- so I'd like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is.
Because our home is the universe, and we are the universe, essentially.
We carry that in us.
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all, I think, in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe.
Thank you.
So, why does good sex so often fade, even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever?
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex, contrary to popular belief?
Or, the next question would be, can we want what we already have?
That's the million-dollar question, right?
And why is the forbidden so erotic?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent?
And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic disaster in couples?
It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it?
And when you love, how does it feel?
And when you desire, how is it different?
These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love.
So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire.
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term, not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs.
On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence -- all these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives that we call home.
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey, for travel.
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call a passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms.
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship.
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long.
So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one.
Give me comfort, give me edge.
Give me novelty, give me familiarity.
Give me predictability, give me surprise.
And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.
So now we get to the existential reality of the story, right?
Because I think, in some way -- and I'll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination.
So why does good sex so often fade?
What is the relationship between love and desire?
How do they relate, and how do they conflict?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism.
So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."
And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want."
In love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved.
We want to minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap.
We want to neutralize the tensions. We want closeness.
But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to the places we've already gone.
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest.
In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what goes on in their red light district.
In desire, we want a bridge to cross.
Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air.
Desire needs space.
And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.
But then I took a question with me.
And I've gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with "Mating in Captivity," and I asked people, when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner?
Not attracted sexually, per se, but most drawn.
And across culture, across religion, and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back.
So the first group is: I am most drawn to my partner when she is away, when we are apart, when we reunite.
Basically, when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner, when my imagination comes back in the picture, and when I can root it in absence and in longing, which is a major component of desire.
But then the second group is even more interesting: I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio, when she is onstage, when he is in his element, when she's doing something she's passionate about, when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him, when I see her hold court.
Basically, when I look at my partner radiant and confident, probably the biggest turn-on across the board.
Radiant, as in self-sustaining.
I look at this person -- by the way, in desire people rarely talk about it, when we are blended into one, five centimeters from each other. I don't know in inches how much that is.
But it's also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them.
It's when I'm looking at my partner from a comfortable distance, where this person that is already so familiar, so known, is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan, lies that movement toward the other.
Because sometimes, as Proust says, mystery is not about traveling to new places, but it's about looking with new eyes.
And so, when I see my partner on his own or her own, doing something in which they are enveloped, I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception, and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me.
And then, more importantly, in this description about the other or myself -- it's the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire.
Nobody needs anybody.
There is no caretaking in desire.
Caretaking is mightily loving. It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them.
Wanting them is one thing. Needing them is a shutdown, and women have known that forever, because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge.
For good reasons, right?
And then the third group of answers usually would be when I'm surprised, when we laugh together, as somebody said to me in the office today, when he's in his tux, so I said, you know, it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.
But basically it's when there is novelty.
But novelty isn't about new positions. It isn't a repertoire of techniques.
Novelty is, what parts of you do you bring out?
What parts of you are just being seen?
Because in some way one could say sex isn't something you do, eh?
Sex is a place you go. It's a space you enter inside yourself and with another, or others.
So where do you go in sex?
What parts of you do you connect to?
What do you seek to express there?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union?
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes?
What comes out there? It's a language.
It isn't just a behavior.
And it's the poetic of that language that I'm interested in, which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence.
You know, animals have sex.
It's the pivot, it's biology, it's the natural instinct.
We are the only ones who have an erotic life, which means that it's sexuality transformed by the human imagination.
We are the only ones who can make love for hours, have a blissful time, multiple orgasms, and touch nobody, just because we can imagine it.
We can hint at it. We don't even have to do it.
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation, which is a mortar to desire, the ability to imagine it, as if it's happening, to experience it as if it's happening, while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time.
So when I began to think about eroticism, I began to think about the poetics of sex, and if I look at it as an intelligence, then it's something that you cultivate.
What are the ingredients? Imagination, playfulness, novelty, curiosity, mystery.
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination.
But more importantly, for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark, what sustains desire, I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism, the mystical definition, and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma, which is the other side, and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in, which was a community in Belgium, all Holocaust survivors, and in my community there were two groups: those who didn't die, and those who came back to life.
And those who didn't die lived often very tethered to the ground, could not experience pleasure, could not trust, because when you're vigilant, worried, anxious, and insecure, you can't lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative.
Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death.
They knew how to keep themselves alive.
And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with, I sometimes would hear people say, "I want more sex," but generally people want better sex, and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness, of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality, of eros, of energy that sex used to afford them, or that they've hoped it would afford them.
And so I began to ask a different question.
"I shut myself off when ..." began to be the question.
"I turn off my desires when ..." which is not the same question as, "What turns me off is ..." and "You turn me off when ..."
And people began to say, "I turn myself off when I feel dead inside, when I don't like my body, when I feel old, when I haven't had time for myself, when I haven't had a chance to even check in with you, when I don't perform well at work, when I feel low self esteem, when I don't have a sense of self-worth, when I don't feel like I have a right to want, to take, to receive pleasure."
And then I began to ask the reverse question.
"I turn myself on when ..." Because most of the time, people like to ask the question, "You turn me on, what turns me on," and I'm out of the question. You know?
Now, if you are dead inside, the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine's.
It won't make a dent. There is nobody at the reception desk.
So I turn myself on when, I turn my desires, I wake up when ...
Now, in this paradox between love and desire, what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality, reciprocity, protection, worry, responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire.
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love: jealousy, possessiveness, aggression, power, dominance, naughtiness, mischief.
Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day.
You know, the erotic mind is not very politically correct.
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses, we wouldn't be having such interesting talks about this.
But no, in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don't always know how to bring to the person that we love, because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word: the ability to stay connected to one's self in the presence of another.
So I want to draw that little image for you, because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs, we are born with that.
Our need for connection, our need for separateness, or our need for security and adventure, or our need for togetherness and for autonomy, and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable, and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore.
That's the beginning of desire, that exploratory needs curiosity, discovery.
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you, and if you tell them, "Hey kiddo, the world's a great place. Go for it.
There's so much fun out there," then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time.
They can go off in their imagination, off in their body, off in their playfulness, all the while knowing that there's somebody when they come back.
But if on this side there is somebody who says, "I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed.
My partner hasn't taken care of me in so long.
What's so good out there? Don't we have everything you need together, you and I?"
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize.
Some of us will come back, came back a long time ago, and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other.
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection.
And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection, and I won't know how to leave you in order to go play, in order to go experience pleasure, in order to discover, to enter inside myself.
Translate this into adult language.
It starts very young. It continues into our sex lives up to the end.
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time.
"Are you going to be there?
Are you going to curse me? Are you going to scold me?
Are you going to be angry with me?"
And they may be gone, but they're never really away, and those are often the people that will tell you, in the beginning it was super hot.
Because in the beginning, the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire.
The more connected I became, the more responsible I felt, the less I was able to let go in your presence.
The third child doesn't really come back.
So what happens, if you want to sustain desire, it's that real dialectic piece.
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go.
On the other hand if you can't go, you can't have pleasure, you can't culminate, you don't have an orgasm, you don't get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own.
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs, there are a few things that I've come to understand erotic couples do.
One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them.
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing.
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm.
They also understand that an erotic space isn't about, you begin to stroke the other.
It's about you create a space where you leave Management Inc., maybe where you leave the agile program, and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible.
Responsibility and desire just butt heads.
They don't really do well together.
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
They know how to bring it back, and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth, which is the myth of spontaneity, which is that it's just going to fall from heaven while you're folding the laundry like a deus ex machina, and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has.
Committed sex is premeditated sex.
It's willful. It's intentional.
It's focus and presence.
Merry Valentine's.

Trees epitomize stasis.
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become very dynamic entities, moving and growing.
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists.
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art.
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year, I simply measured and summed each of those lines.
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year.
You might have a guess.
The answer is actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe.
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic.
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is our prisons.
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined behind bars.
And our prison system itself is stuck.
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women.
That number is rising.
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison.
Funds for education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the answer is yes.
In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections.
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons.
We give science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting.
That, I think, is movement.
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
That, I think, is movement.
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands.
That, I think, is movement.
And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities.
They've incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners.
They're kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day.
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this.
For one hour a day they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images of nature.
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence.
And so what we see, I think, is that small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope.
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks.
But if trees can create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change.
Thank you very much.
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.
We're so excited to be here. It's such an honor for us.
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. We hope you guys will too.
This next song is an original we wrote called "Timelapse," and it will probably live up to its name.
TM: Thank you very much.
RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band.
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.
He's also our brother.
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.
As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves, and we chose to play three songs in three different keys.
Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name Sleepy Man Banjo Boys from.
So it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping.
So you can probably piece the rest together.
TM: We can't really figure out the reason for this.
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.
TM: Thank you very much.
RM: Thank you.
As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design?
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore?
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions, what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience?
If we could free ourselves from our education?
What would these unseen forms look like?
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
Would they delight us?
If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?
I propose we look to nature.
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.
And I'm not saying that we should copy nature, I'm not saying we should mimic biology, instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
We can abstract them and to create something that is new.
Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells.
And these cells can either be identical, or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.
If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces.
We're free to choose where we make the fold.
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.
Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm.
And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
We can fold a million times faster, we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional, we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.
A simple volume, the cube.
If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks, for instance, like this.
And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one.
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape, or this shape.
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.
And we can play with this.
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.
We can begin to sculpt the form.
And because we're doing the folding on the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints.
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves, they can become impossibly small.
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
Surfaces can become porous.
They can stretch. They can tear.
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.
But in each case, I didn't design the form.
I designed the process that generated the form.
In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.
But that's only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this, but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error.
A far more effective way to create forms, I have found, is to use information that is already contained in forms.
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.
So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.
White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate, and that we can use to control the folding.
So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule, I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded.
And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.
These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
There is a simple input, it's always a cube that I start with, and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold, and doing this over and over again.
So let's bring this process to architecture.
How? And at what scale?
I chose to design a column.
Columns are architectural archetypes.
They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology.
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column.
I started using four cylinders.
Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved into this.
And these columns, they have information at very many scales.
We can begin to zoom into them.
The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.
And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail.
These forms are undrawable.
An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months, or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations, you can only create something like this through an algorithm.
The more interesting question, perhaps, is, are these forms imaginable?
Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing.
In this case, the process is deterministic.
There's no randomness involved at all, but it's not entirely predictable.
There's too many surfaces, there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.
So this leads to a new role for the architect.
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there.
For one thing, one can design many variants of a form, in parallel, and one can cultivate them.
And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.
But enough of the theory.
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue 3D glasses, got up very close to the screen, but still that wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things.
So there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer.
There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.
So instead, we decided to take the column, and we decided to build it as a layered model, made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.
What you're looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.
Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves, to grow on the inside of the column, which was quite a surprising discovery.
From this shape, we calculated a cutting line, and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.
And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering, and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer.
Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.
But it was very labor intensive.
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical.
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium.
And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.
But it is increasingly possible.
Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive, and there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon.
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.
And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns, we used the bigger, faster machine, and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural, they can bear loads for once.
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.
You can see a different column in the mirror, if there's a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion.
So where does this leave us?
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects.
I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature; there's countless other ones.
In short, we have no constraints.
Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up.
And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.
Thank you.
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union, a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside.
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space.
The rocket was huge.
And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside.
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time: "We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik.
In the olden days, explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."
You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature, which is just about completed.
It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result.
For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
All hell broke loose.
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.
It provoked the missile gap.
It exploded an arms race.
It began the space race.
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik.
Support for engineering, math and science -- education in general -- boomed.
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA, and the Internet, and, of course, NASA.
My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.
"Sputnik" will soon be released.
In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors: longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
And I'd like to thank you all.
Thank you, Chris.
OK. We've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind.
And what I'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation, how the will to survive can bring that out in people.
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive.
OK, this is Mount Everest.
It's 29,035 feet high.
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic, making tectonic plate measurements; twice, I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices.
It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.
And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen, and we should have listened to them.
Everest is an extreme environment.
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.
Near the summit, temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero.
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
It's actually a wind-chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars.
I remember one time being up near the summit, I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle, inside my down jacket, only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.
OK, this is the route up Everest.
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up, what's called the Western Cwm.
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse, which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
And then Camp Four is the highest camp; that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.
This is a view of base camp.
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload.
And this is what they unloaded for me: I had four yak loads of medical supplies, which are dumped in a tent, and here I am trying to arrange things.
This was our expedition.
It was a National Geographic expedition, but it was organized by The Explorers Club.
There were three other expeditions on the mountain, an American team, a New Zealand team and an IMAX team.
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.
This is near the top of the icefall.
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.
This is me crossing a crevasse.
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
That's another crevasse.
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more, and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we're climbing over, we would never do it.
Okay. This is Camp One.
It's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall.
And from there we climb up to Camp Two, which is sort of the foreground.
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face, that mountain toward Camp Three.
They're on fixed ropes here.
A fall here, if you weren't roped in, would be 5,000 feet down.
This is a view taken from camp three.
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through.
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
There's no ice over it.
And that's because Everest is so high, it's in the jet stream, and winds are constantly scouring the face, so no snow gets to accumulate.
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit.
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four, moving in, up through the clouds.
And this is at Camp Four.
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited, and you either have to go up or go down, make that decision very quickly.
This is a picture of Rob Hall.
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.
This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I'll tell you about.
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.
This is not good weather to climb in, so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what's called the Triangular Face.
It's the first part of climb.
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next, and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.
So that's what happened.
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.
The summit would be in the foreground.
From here, it's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit.
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.
