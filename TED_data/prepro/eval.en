This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen, and we're not going to show you any of it.
The truth of the matter is that the Titanic -- even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records -- it's not the most exciting story from the sea.
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
Most of the planet is ocean water.
The average depth is about two miles.
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach, or we see images like this of the ocean, and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides, but you have no idea for what lies in there.
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.
Most of the animals are in the oceans.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea.
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests.
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.
We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world.
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras, and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself.
Here's a jelly.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
It gets up to about 150 feet long.
But see all those different working things?
I love that kind of stuff.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
It's a colonial animal.
These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature.
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that, put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals on the other side, those guys win hands down.
Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.
Here's the X-wing death jelly.
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating.
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.
They come in all different sizes and shapes.
We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
And these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space, that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.
You hear about giant squid and things like that, but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
They're very little understood.
This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.
You can actually see through his head.
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.
They come right up to the submarine -- they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.
This is really a world within a world, and we're going to show you two.
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.
And then one of my favorites. What a face!
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing, is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this, in the world where they belong.
They don't catch them in a net.
They're actually looking at them down in that world.
We're going to take a joystick, sit in front of our computer, on the Earth, and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge, a 40,000-mile long mountain range.
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there -- but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America, and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar, and this is one of those mountain ranges.
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases.
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.
This is a volcanic ridge.
We're getting down further and further in scale.
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.
And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time.
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed, hydrogen-sulfide-rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.
So that's all water under the sea -- a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.
And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism, water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor, come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.
This is one of these hydrothermal vents.
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps, so the setting here is very dramatic.
The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at 180 degrees C.
I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea, is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.
And we started to wonder for a long time, how did it all get down there?
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.
Not only is it coming out of the Earth -- so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here.
All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.
And you can see how dense the population is.
These are called tube worms.
These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.
But they have two types of gill structures.
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water, another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria, which takes the hydrothermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.
You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
Oh! Good going.
So, as soon as a crab touches them, they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology.
These worms live in a real temperature extreme.
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C, so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.
That's how they like to live.
This is a female of this kind of worm.
And here's a male.
You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
Here they go.
On one of the last dive series, we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new, new species.
One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.
And they disintegrate on the way up, so the imagery is critical for the science.
Two octopods at about two miles depth.
This pressure thing really amazes me -- that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
And the same thing's going on over here.
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals.
And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.
And the crabs don't like it at all.
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria.
So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.
On the back, you see this again.
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
Those are all shrimp.
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.
They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
Those pillars get up to several stories.
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.
They don't need the sun at all.
You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?
It's actually a light-sensing organ.
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature -- and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.
All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today, as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
We're moving up one of these pillars.
This one's several stories tall.
In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.
There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.
So all of these are individual homes for worms.
Now here's a closer view of that community.
Here's crabs here, worms here.
There are smaller animals crawling around.
Here's pagoda structures.
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.
I just can't get over this -- that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it.
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.
That's probably where we evolved from.
This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.
There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites.
Although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.
It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.
There's a fish sitting here.
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm, waiting for that worm to stick his head out.
The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active.
The worms are growing inches per week!
I already said that this site, from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.
Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood -- that plumbing system turns off every year or so.
Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.
And then there's earthquakes, and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years, that completely wipes the area out.
Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again, higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
Is it sensitive? Yes.
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
I'll end up with saying one thing.
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea, in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
It's an incredible story.
What we see when we look back in time, in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.
The continents move apart. They come back together.
Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
It's just like music -- it really is just like music.
And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say, "Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."
It's absurd. It's just absurd.
So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it.
Learn to manage it.
The concept of preservation is futile.
Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I'm here today to start a revolution.
Now before you get up in arms, or you break into song, or you pick a favorite color, I want to define what I mean by revolution.
By revolution, I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave.
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?
We need a revolution because things aren't working; they're just not working.
And that makes me really sad because I'm sick and tired of things not working.
You know, I'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential.
I'm sick and tired of us being last.
And we are last place in so many things -- for example, social factors.
We're last place in Europe in innovation.
There we are right at the end, right at the bottom, last place as a culture that doesn't value innovation.
We're last place in health care, and that's important for a sense of well-being.
And there we are, not just last in the E.U., we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.
And worst of all, it just came out three weeks ago, many of you have seen it, The Economist.
We're the saddest place on Earth, relative to GDP per capita -- the saddest place on Earth.
That's social. Let's look at education.
Where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD?
Last in reading, math and science. Last.
Business: The lowest perception in the E.U.
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.
Why as a result, what happens?
The lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses.
And this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies.
We hire the most people; we create the most taxes.
So if our engine's broken, guess what?
Last in Europe GDP per capita.
Last.
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future.
We're unhappy, we have bad education, and we have the worst businesses.
And these are facts, guys.
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.
It's not.
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.
So I think it should be really, really clear that our system is broken.
The way we think, the way we behave, our operating system of behaving is broken.
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better, for ourselves, for our friends, for our family and for our future.
How did this happen?
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?
I think we're last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handicapping ourselves.
We're holding ourselves back because we don't value play.
I said "play," all right.
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.
Babies play, kids play, adults play.
We don't value play.
In fact, we devalue play.
And we devalue it in three areas.
Let's go back to the same three areas.
Social: 45 years of what?
Of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squashing, inadvertently, creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.
And instead, what do we value?
Because it's shown the way we apply, generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context, which told us what in communism?
To be serious.
To be really, really serious.
It did.
Be serious.
I can't tell you how many times I've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground.
Heaven forbid they play in the dirt, the kal, or even worse, lokvi, water -- that will kill them.
I have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.
We have a serious meme running through.
It's a social gene running through us.
It's a serious gene.
It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the "baba factor."
And here's how it works.
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!
But then what happens in step three?
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.
I'm going to give bebko to baba.
But we need to remember that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.
So what happens?
She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system.
What happens then?
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self-expression, self-exploration, questioning, creativity and play.
It's a crap system.
True story: I went looking for a school for my kid.
We went to this prestigious little school and they say they're going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff.
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."
And we said, "He's five."
What a crime. What a crime.
And it's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we're creating mindless, robotic workers to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.
But I'm sorry, the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.
We need adaptability, the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.
We don't need mechanized workers.
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets, to lever and just throw away.
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?
Autocratic -- do what I say because I'm the chef.
I'm the boss and I know better than you.
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.
Controlling -- you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone, don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet, don't be on I.M.
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued and you're not having any fun.
In social, in education and in our business, don't value play.
And that's why we're last, because we don't value play.
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.
It can't be because of play.
Just play, that's a stupid thing."
We have the serious meme in us.
Well I'm going to say no.
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.
Play: our brains are hardwired for play.
Evolution has selected, over millions and billions of years, for play in animals and in humans.
And you know what?
Evolution does a really, really good job of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage.
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.
Throughout the animal kingdom, for example: ants. Ants play.
Maybe you didn't know that.
But when they're playing, they're learning the social order and dynamics of things.
Rats play, but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better, skills.
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.
But what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially.
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.
Bears play.
But what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer.
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.
It's the ones that play more.
And a final really interesting study -- it's been shown, a correlation between play and brain size.
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.
But who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players?
Yours truly: humans.
Kids play, we play -- of every nationality, of every race, of every color, of every religion.
It's a universal thing -- we play.
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.
Really cool term: neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.
And who are the biggest neotenists?
Humans. We play sports.
We do it for fun, or as Olympians, or as professionals.
We play musical instruments.
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around.
We're designed by nature to play from birth to old age.
We're designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing.
It is a huge benefit.
Just like there's benefits to animals, there's benefits to humans.
For example, it's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala, in the area where it controls emotions.
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening.
As a result, what happens?
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.
We develop better decision-making ability if we play more.
These guys are facts.
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe; it's cold, hard science.
These are the benefits to play.
It is a genetic birthright that we have, like walking or speaking or seeing.
And if we handicap ourselves with play, we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birthright that we have.
We hold ourselves back.
Little exercise just for a second: close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play.
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts, without song, without dancing, without soccer, without football, without laughter.
What does this world look like?
It's pretty bleak.
It's pretty glum.
Now imagine your workplace.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling, restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?
We have this concept that the opposite of play is work.
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work," or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.
He's going to think I'm not working hard."
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.
The opposite of play is not work.
The opposite of play is depression. It's depression.
In fact, play improves our work.
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
It increases our openness to change.
It improves our ability to learn.
It provides a sense of purpose and mastery -- two key motivational things that increase productivity, through play.
So before you start thinking of play as just not serious, play doesn't mean frivolous.
You know, the professional athlete that loves skiing, he's serious about it, but he loves it.
He's having fun, he's in the groove, he's in the flow.
A doctor might be serious, but laughter's still a great medicine.
Our thinking is backwards.
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.
We should be celebrating play.
Quick example from the corporate world.
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.
If you treat your people like people, if you treat them great, they're happier, they're fulfilled, they have a sense of mastery and purpose.
What happens? They give better service -- not worse, but better.
And when customers call for service and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled, how do the customers feel? They feel great.
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?
They buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends, which leads to more profit.
People, service, profit.
Play increases productivity, not decreases.
And you're going to say, "Gee, that can work for FedEx out there in the United States, but it can't work in Bulgaria.
No way. We're different."
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
One, play is universal.
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.
Not one customer would refer us.
I asked them all.
We had marginal profit -- I did.
We had marginal profits, and we had unhappy stakeholders.
Through some basic change, change like improving transparency, change like promoting self-direction and collaboration, encouraging collaboration, not autocracy, the things like having a results-focus.
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you're organized with that.
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?
Basically promoting fun.
Through promoting fun and a great environment, we were able to transform Sciant and, in just three short years -- sounds like a long time, but change is slow -- every customer, from zero to every customer referring us, above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders.
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"
Well we did win, every year that we entered, one of the rankings for best employer for small business.
Independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys.
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.
There's nothing holding us back, except our own mentality about play.
So some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play.
First of all, you have to believe me.
If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something.
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game.
Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.
You're the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution.
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it, your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you, and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
I'm going to let you challenge authority.
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today.
We're not always right as leaders.
We're going to eradicate fear.
Fear is the enemy of play.
And we're going to do things like eliminate restrictions.
You know what, let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid.
Let them be on the Internet.
Let them be on instant messengers.
Let them take long lunches.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before.
Let them do it. Give them some freedom, and in general, let them play. Let them have fun at the workplace.
We spend so much of our lives at the workplace, and it's supposed to be, what, a miserable grind, so that 20 years from now, we wake up and say, "Is this it?
Is that all there was?"
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.
So in summary, we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave, but we don't need a workers' revolution.
We don't need a workers' revolution.
What we need is a players' uprising.
What we need is a players' uprising.
What we need is a players' uprising.
Seriously, we need to band together.
Today is the start of the uprising.
But what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution.
You need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigorating our lives, our schools, and our work with play; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-fulfillment; of how play promotes innovation and productivity, and, ultimately, how play creates meaning.
Because we can't do it alone. We have to do it together, and together, if we do this and share these ideas on play, we can transform Bulgaria for the better.
Thank you.

Radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education.
We have such a hard time figuring out that learning is not a place but an activity.
But I want to tell you the story of PISA, OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds around the world, and it's really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat as an affair of domestic policy.
Look at how the world looked in the 1960s, in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school.
You can see the United States ahead of everyone else, and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mover in education.
But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.
In the 1980s, the global expansion of the talent pool continued.
And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.
So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
In the '90s, it was 13th, and not because standards had fallen, but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.
Korea shows you what's possible in education.
Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today, and was one of the lowest education performers.
Today, every young Korean finishes high school.
So this tells us that, in a global economy, it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success, but the best performing education systems internationally.
The trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do.
Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets, while employers say they cannot find the people with the skills they need.
And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives.
So with PISA, we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly.
And we took a very special angle to this.
We were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school, but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations.
Now, some people have criticized us for this.
They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people, because we test students with problems they haven't seen before.
But if you take that logic, you know, you should consider life unfair, because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school, but whether we are prepared for change, whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created, to use technologies that haven't been invented, to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.
And once hotly contested, our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
In our latest assessment in 2009, we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy.
This chart shows you the performance of countries.
In red, sort of below OECD average.
Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.
You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia; Finland in Europe; Canada in North America doing really well.
You can also see that there is a gap of almost three and a half school years between 15-year-olds in Shanghai and 15-year-olds in Chile, and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance.
There's a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today's economy.
But I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture.
Educators like to talk about equity.
With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity, in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances.
And we see that in some countries, the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very, very strong.
Opportunities are unequally distributed.
A lot of potential of young children is wasted.
We see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you're born.
We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant, where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there, where performance is poor and there are large social disparities.
And then we can debate, you know, is it better to be there, where performance is strong at the price of large disparities?
Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?
But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture, you see there are a lot of countries that actually are combining excellence with equity.
In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison is that you don't have to compromise equity to achieve excellence.
These countries have moved on from providing excellence for just some to providing excellence for all, a very important lesson.
And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems that believe they are mainly there to sort people.
And ever since those results came out, policymakers, educators, researchers from around the world have tried to figure out what's behind the success of those systems.
But let's step back for a moment and focus on the countries that actually started PISA, and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.
And I'm making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students.
If money would tell you everything about the quality of learning outcomes, you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?
But that's not what you see.
Spending per student only explains about, well, less than 20 percent of the performance variation among countries, and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system, doesn't do particularly well.
What you see is that two countries with similar spending achieve very different results.
You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings -- that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided between rich and well-educated countries, and poor and badly-educated ones, a very, very important lesson.
Let's look at this in greater detail.
The red dot shows you spending per student relative to a country's wealth.
One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well, and you can see Korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.
And Korea also invests into long school days, which drives up costs further.
Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers not only to teach but also to develop.
They invest in professional development and collaboration and many other things.
All that costs money.
How can Korea afford all of this?
The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg, and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea, so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.
But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers in Luxembourg all like small classes.
You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.
So they have invested all their money into there, and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.
But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once, and the price for this is that teachers are not paid particularly well.
Students don't have long hours of learning.
And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.
So you can see two countries spent their money very differently, and actually how they spent their money matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
Let's go back to the year 2000.
Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.
This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance.
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better?
And the bitter truth really is that, you know, not in many countries.
But there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements.
Germany, my own country, in the year 2000, featured in the lower quadrant, below average performance, large social disparities.
And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.
Very disappointing results.
People were stunned by the results.
And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany was dominated for months by education, not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education was the center of the public debate.
And then policymakers began to respond to this.
The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.
A lot was done to increase the life chances of students with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about optimizing existing policies, but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms underlying German education.
For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities when they sent their children to kindergarten.
PISA has transformed that debate, and pushed early childhood education right at the center of public policy in Germany.
Or traditionally, the German education divides children at the age of 10, very young children, between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers, and that mainly along socioeconomic lines, and that paradigm is being challenged now too.
A lot of change.
And the good news is, nine years later, you can see improvements in quality and equity.
People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.
Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.
In the year 2000, Korea did already very well, but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.
They took up the challenge, and Korea was able to double the proportion of students achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.
Well, if you only focus on your brightest students, you know what happens is disparities grow, and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction, but still, an impressive improvement.
A major overhaul of Poland's education helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools, turn around many of the lowest-performing schools, and raise performance by over half a school year.
And you can see other countries as well.
Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system, raise quality and improve equity, and so did Hungary.
So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.
And even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture, of economic factors, of social issues, of homogeneity of societies, and so on, these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.
It didn't change its economy. It didn't change the compositions of its population.
It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies and practice. Very impressive.
And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn from those countries in the green quadrant who have achieved high levels of equity, high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context provide a model elsewhere?
Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale, but these comparisons have identified a range of factors that high-performing systems share.
Everybody agrees that education is important.
Everybody says that.
But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority against other priorities?
How do countries pay their teachers relative to other highly skilled workers?
Would you want your child to become a teacher rather than a lawyer?
How do the media talk about schools and teachers?
Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems, the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices that value education, their future, more than consumption today.
And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it, but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the school.
Those things really exist.
But placing a high value on education is just part of the picture.
The other part is the belief that all children are capable of success.
You have some countries where students are segregated early in their ages.
You know, students are divided up, reflecting the belief that only some children can achieve world-class standards.
But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe, parents and teachers in those countries expect every student to succeed, and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.
When we asked students what counts for success in mathematics, students in North America would typically tell us, you know, it's all about talent.
If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.
Nine out of 10 Japanese students say that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort, and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
High performers on PISA embrace diversity with differentiated pedagogical practices.
They realize that ordinary students have extraordinary talents, and they personalize learning opportunities.
High-performing systems also share clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
Every student knows what matters.
Every student knows what's required to be successful.
And nowhere does the quality of an education system exceed the quality of its teachers.
High-performing systems are very careful in how they recruit and select their teachers and how they train them.
They watch how they improve the performances of teachers in difficulties who are struggling, and how they structure teacher pay.
They provide an environment also in which teachers work together to frame good practice.
And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow in their careers.
In bureaucratic school systems, teachers are often left alone in classrooms with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.
They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable their teachers to figure out, what do I need to teach to my students today?
The past was about delivered wisdom in education.
Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
High performers have moved on from professional or from administrative forms of accountability and control -- sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education -- to professional forms of work organization.
They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.
They provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices.
The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
High-performing systems have made teachers and school principals inventive.
In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes, on provision.
The high-performing systems have helped teachers and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher, the next school around their lives.
And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA, but what makes Finland so impressive is that only five percent of the performance variation amongst students lies between schools.
Every school succeeds.
This is where success is systemic.
And how do they do that?
They invest resources where they can make the most difference.
They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools, and the most talented teachers into the most challenging classroom.
Last but not least, those countries align policies across all areas of public policy.
They make them coherent over sustained periods of time, and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
Now, knowing what successful systems are doing doesn't yet tell us how to improve.
That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits of international comparisons of PISA are.
That's where other forms of research need to kick in, and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into telling countries what they should be doing.
But its strength lies in telling them what everybody else has been doing.
And the example of PISA shows that data can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy through which we usually run education systems.
You know, some people argue that changing educational administration is like moving graveyards.
You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this.
But PISA has shown what's possible in education.
It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.
And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
If we can help every child, every teacher, every school, every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible, that only the sky is the limit to education improvement, we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change, and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers, from 113 countries.
It's a big community. It's such a big community, in fact, that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.
And every one of those scientists is in a research group, and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño oscillation, which affects weather and climate, to the assimilation of satellite data, to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I happen to study.
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more, there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics, things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here. It's a small organic molecule. You've probably never heard of it.
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.
But despite its very small weight, enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
We blow it up and look at the pieces.
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion, takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.
But still, we look at the pieces.
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations.
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia. There are others.
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there, in the middle of the rainforest, and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower, to look for isoprene, and of course, other things while we were there.
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest, from above.
And this is the tower from below.
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.
And this plane, the model, BA146, which was run by FAAM, normally flies 120 to 130 people.
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
But we didn't just fly it. We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff.
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements.
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering.
We have to get special flight clearance.
And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs.
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule, they write one scientific paper on the subject.
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules.
And as a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection, or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.
In each one of those assessments that we write, we always tag on a summary, and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers, in order to make headlines like these.
Thank you very much.

Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back, just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.
You can mimic what you can see.
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.
I'm going to tell you about that technology.
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.
People envision this as being very difficult.
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
It was terribly dangerous.
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
But now, we have a real technology to do this.
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind.
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain: the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time, it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.
They're watching their own brain activation, and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.
As they do it, in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.
This is an investigational technology, but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.
When you do, what do you want to control?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.
But I want to leave with you the big question.
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into, using this technology, the human mind and brain.
Where will we take it?
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form.
From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant, teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet, human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable.
We are inveterate storytellers.
But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world, do we offer communality of experience, unmediated by our own furious consumerism?
And what narrative, what history, what identity, what moral code are we imparting to our young?
Cinema is arguably the 20th century's most influential art form.
Its artists told stories across national boundaries, in as many languages, genres and philosophies as one can imagine.
Indeed, it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle.
During the last decade we've seen a vast integration of global media, now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation, not story, is king.
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified.
As a filmmaker, it worried me.
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they've come from and so few narratives of what's possible?
The irony is palpable; technical access has never been greater, cultural access never weaker.
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB, an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions.
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film, maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young.
Given the access to technology, even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board.
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K., with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
The films were curated and contextualized.
But the choice was theirs, and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
The outcome, immediate.
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three, these young people discovered new places, new thoughts, new perspectives.
By the time the pilot had finished, we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join.
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration.
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema, find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
But for my father, the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends, "In order," he said, "to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation."
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
And the speed with which they associate it with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature.
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government, we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor.
Shortly after "Mr. Smith" became a FILMCLUB classic, there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
In choosing "Hotel Rwanda," they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
And when "Schindler's List" demanded that they never forget, one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked, "We already forgot, otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
"Pickpocket" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement.
"To Sir, with Love" ignited its teen audience.
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons, but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity, unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white, subtitled, documentary, non-narrative, fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week.
From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands, until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country.
And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary, what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life.
Some of our kids started talking with their parents, others with their teachers, or with their friends.
And those without friends started making them.
The films provided communality across all manner of divide.
And the stories they held provided a shared experience.
"Persepolis" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother, and "Jaws" became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother, the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
Who was right, who wrong?
What would they do under the same conditions?
Was the tale told well?
Was there a hidden message?
How has the world changed? How could it be different?
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn't think were interested.
And they themselves had not known they cared.
And as they wrote and debated, rather than seeing the films as artifacts, they began to see themselves.
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
Quite recently she told me that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions, it was these teenagers that fed the crew.
I was past 40 when my father died.
He never mentioned that journey.
My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
After two years in hiding, my grandfather appeared in London.
He was never right again.
And his story was hushed as he assimilated.
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
I had "Anne Frank," "The Great Escape," "Shoah," "Triumph of the Will."
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure.
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud, and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt's wrist.
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding, that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history, or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
As one 12-year-old said after watching "Wizard of Oz," "Every person should watch this, because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart."
We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
Consider "Citizen Kane" as valuable as Jane Austen.
Agree that "Boyz n the Hood," like Tennyson, offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together.
Each a piece of memorable art, each a brick in the wall of who we are.
And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human, and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
We guessed that film, whose stories are a meeting place of drama, music, literature and human experience, would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers, fight, not on the playground, but to choose next week's film -- young people who have found self-definition, ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed.
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young.
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
They are, like other young people, negotiating a world with infinite choice, but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes, yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
If we want different values we have to tell a different story, a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity, that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity, and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group.
Because when these people get home after a screening of "Rear Window" and raise their gaze to the building next door, they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them, is out there and what is their story.
Thank you.
It's a great time to be a molecular biologist.
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper.
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros.
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector.
It has the power, potentially, to replace our fossil fuels, to revolutionize medicine, and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.
So who gets to do it?
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it.
But what about that guy?
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone, not just scientists and people in government labs.
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate, it could really stimulate innovation.
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea of what their needs are.
And here's this really sophisticated technology coming down the road, all these associated social, moral, ethical questions, and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.
So wouldn't it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff, do it hands-on?
I thought so.
So, three years ago, I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace.
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab in Brooklyn, New York, and the idea was people could come, they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open, friendly atmosphere.
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next. Can you guess?
The press started calling us.
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy, the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein, and as a result, for the next six months, when you Googled my name, instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.
["Am I a biohazard?"] It was pretty depressing.
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world, there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were.
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did, more regulations, less resources.
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces, and this is just the beginning.
These are some of the biggest ones, and there are others opening every day.
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow, one in South Korea, and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of.
Let me take you on a little tour.
Biohackers work alone.
We work in groups, in big cities — — and in small villages.
We reverse engineer lab equipment.
We genetically engineer bacteria.
We hack hardware, software, wetware, and, of course, the code of life.
We like to build things.
Then we like to take things apart.
We make things grow.
We make things glow.
And we make cells dance.
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive, but, you know, sometimes when people think of us, the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety, bio-security, all the dark side stuff.
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use, and, you know, you get something like synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology, it really compels you, you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups, because they have better infrastructure, they have better facilities, and they have access to pathogens.
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently issued a report on this whole area, and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative, and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community, and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics.
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world, America, Europe, got together last year, and we hammered out a common code of ethics.
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.
Now, we follow state and local regulations.
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
And sometimes people ask me, "Well, what about an accident?"
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it.
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study, they're going to take my entire genomic sequence, all of my medical information, and my identity, and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion.
The one I liked the best is, someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab, synthesize some fake Ellen DNA, and plant it at a crime scene.
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk.
Now, you might be asking yourself, "Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well, what would anyone do with a personal computer?"
So this stuff is just beginning.
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.
Let me show you what you could do right now.
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva, identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.
Looked like a ladybug, right?
It actually is a Japanese beetle.
And the same kind of technology -- it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga, if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat's.
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome for mutations.
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's, and you can explore your ancestry.
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere, collect microbes, see what's up there.
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water.
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.
You can do a lot of things.
You can also do an art science project. Some of these are really spectacular, and they look at social, ecological problems from a completely different perspective.
It's really cool.
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
It just has to follow safety guidelines.
If you had spaces like this all over the world, it could really change the perception of who's allowed to do biotech.
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.
Why not personal biotech?
If everyone in this room got involved, who knows what we could do?
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That was whistling.
I'm trying to do this in English.
What is a chubby, curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling?
Well actually, I've [been] whistling since the age of four, about four.
My dad was always whistling around the house, and I just thought that's part of communication in my family.
So I whistled along with him.
And actually, till I was 34, I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling, because, to be honest, my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior.
I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom.
I whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere.
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law.
And they had some, in my opinion, terrible Christmas music.
And when I hear music that I don't like, I try to make it better.
So "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" -- you know it?
But it can also sound like this.
But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it's very annoying.
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times, "Please stop whistling."
And I just couldn't.
And at one point -- and I had some wine, I have to admit that -- at one point I said, "If there was a contest, I would join."
And two weeks later I received a text message: "You're going to America."
So, okay, I'm going to America.
I would love to, but why?
So I immediately called her up, of course.
She Googled, and she found this World Whistling Championship in America, of course.
She didn't expect me to go there.
And I would have lost my face.
I don't know if that's correct English.
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean.
I lost my face.
And she thought, "He will never go there."
But actually I did.
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina, southeast United States, and I entered the world of whistling.
And I also entered the world championship, and I won there in 2004.
That was great fun, of course.
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought, well let's go back in 2005, and I won again.
Then I couldn't participate for a few years.
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.
So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam, in the beautiful city, on a big stage, and I'm talking about whistling.
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment.
So I quit my day job as a nurse.
And I try to live my dream -- well, actually, it was never my dream, but it sounds so good.
Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here.
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"
Well actually, you are going to whistle along.
And then always the same thing happens: people are watching each other and think, "Oh, my God.
Why? Can I go away?"
No, you can't.
Actually it's very simple.
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."
It's about 80 minutes long.
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling.
So I whistle the tone.
Sorry. I forgot one thing.
You whistle the same tone as me.
I heard a wide variety of tones.
This is very promising.
This is very promising.
I'll ask the technicians to start the music.
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.
Oh, hah.
I'm so sorry, technicians.
I'm so used to that.
I start it myself.
Okay, here it is.
Okay.
It's easy, isn't it?
Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself.
Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou, the World Champion [of] Whistling.
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
You're about to experience a new, available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives.
What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material.
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry, and when you apply it to any material, it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
So this is a cinder block, uncoated, and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.
Not anymore.
Porous, nonporous.
So what's superhydrophobic?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface.
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is, and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees.
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves, and we've coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating, and let's see if you can tell which one, and I'll give you a hint.
Did you guess the one that was dry?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.
And we're talking really small here.
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers, and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick, and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair.
So very small, but very useful.
And it's not just water that this works with.
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well.
You can see the difference.
Moving onto the next demonstration, we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating, and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle, and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops, and I can't even coax it to leave.
It's that afraid of the water.
So what's going on here? What's happening?
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air.
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry.
So what are the applications?
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says, "Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."
The applications in a general sense could be anything that's anti-wetting.
We've certainly seen that today.
It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
It could be anti-corrosion.
No water, no corrosion.
It could be anti-bacterial.
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work.
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration, but before I do that, I would like to say thank you, and think small.
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.
You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED?
[Two minutes later...] He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
It's happening!
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality.
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital.
I was burned very badly.
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital, you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach.
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach?
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip, and they would grab hold and they would rip.
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.
And as you can imagine, I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.
And I would try to reason with them and say, "Why don't we try something else?
Why don't we take it a little longer -- maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"
And the nurses told me two things.
They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.
And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do, and they kept on doing what they were doing.
And about three years later, when I left the hospital, I started studying at the university.
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question, maybe learn something about the world.
So that's what I did.
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
So originally I didn't have much money, so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit.
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods, and pain that went up and pain that went down, and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them, so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?
Or, if you had to choose between the last two, which one would you choose?
I kept on doing this for a while.
And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks -- I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.
But at the end of this process, what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience, and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
It turns out that because we don't encode duration in the way that we encode intensity, I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower.
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face, which was much more painful, and move toward my legs, giving me a trend of improvement over time -- that would have been also less painful.
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
All of these would have been great things to do, and my nurses had no idea.
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
And it turns out it's a more general case -- there's a lot of mistakes we do.
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating.
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting, but also it tells us something, I think, about the stock market situation we're in.
So, my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden, and I started thinking about what is happening here.
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things, or are we talking a more endemic situation, that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.
And here's how it went.
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve, but I wouldn't give you enough time.
When the five minutes were over, I would say, "Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems.
Other people I would tempt to cheat.
I would pass their sheet of paper.
When the five minutes were over, I would say, "Please shred the piece of paper.
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack, and tell me how many questions you got correctly."
People now solved seven questions on average.
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot.
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
Now, in economic theory, cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.
You say, what's the probability of being caught?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis, and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.
So, we try to test this.
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal.
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases, people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
What about the probability of being caught?
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper, so there was some evidence left.
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room, and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down, people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit, and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.
So we said, "If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces, what could be going on?"
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit, and still feel good about ourselves.
So, maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over, but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree, as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
We call this like a personal fudge factor.
Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
So, we got people to the lab, and we said, "We have two tasks for you today."
First, we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school, or to recall The Ten Commandments, and then we tempted them with cheating.
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
It wasn't that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less, and the less religious people -- the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments -- cheated more.
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments, they stopped cheating.
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat, they don't cheat at all.
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system, so we said, "Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"
So, we got people to sign, "I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.
And this is particularly interesting, because MIT doesn't have an honor code.
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.
What about increasing the fudge factor?
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills, and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.
No bill ever disappeared.
Now, this is not a good social science experiment, so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before.
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it, they came to us and said, "Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper, they came to us and said, "Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side, and exchanged it for dollars.
Think about the following intuition.
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home, compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?
These things feel very differently.
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference?
Our subjects doubled their cheating.
I'll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute.
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet, because in Enron, there's also a social element.
People see each other behaving.
In fact, every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating.
What does this cause us?
So, we did another experiment.
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment, and we prepaid them.
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment, and we told them that at the end, we asked them to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?
The same thing happens.
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said, "I solved everything. What do I do now?"
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.
That's it. The task is finished."
So, now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group.
Nobody knew it was an actor.
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.
What would happen to the other people in the group?
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?
Here is what happens.
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.
Here is the thing.
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities, Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students.
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt, cheating went down.
Now, this is important, because remember, when the moment the student stood up, it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating, because the experimenter said, "You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.
It was about the norms for cheating.
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating, we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people -- I mean, not terrible in this -- but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with, from another university, another group, all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less.
So, what have we learned from this about cheating?
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
They cheat just by a little bit.
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.
When we get bigger distance from cheating, from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.
And when we see cheating around us, particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market, think about what happens.
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way?
Would they not be able to see it this way?
Of course they would.
What happens when you do other things, like you remove things from money?
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives, mortgage-backed securities.
Could it be that with those more distant things, it's not a token for one second, it's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them?
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market.
More generally, I want to tell you something about behavioral economics.
We have many intuitions in our life, and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition in our private life, in our business life, and most particularly when it goes to policy, when we think about things like No Child Left Behind, when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies -- taxation, health care and so on.
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
And I learned two interesting things.
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie, told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.
But think about me as a nurse, taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked, and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said, "I did not think that your intuition was right.
I felt my intuition was correct."
So, if you think about all of your intuitions, it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." -- she thought her intuition was right -- it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong.
But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability, how the economy works, how we should pay school teachers.
But unless we start testing those intuitions, we're not going to do better.
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition, and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
Thank you very much.
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment.
It's a different idea, because usually, when people talk about early childhood programs, they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants, in preschool, they have better K-12 test scores, better adult earnings.
Now that's all very important, but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development.
And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs, we need to interest state governments in this.
The federal government has a lot on its plate, and state governments are going to have to step up.
So we have to appeal to them, the legislators in the state government, and turn to something they understand, that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy.
Now, by promoting economic development, I don't mean anything magical.
All I mean is, is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents.
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development, they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs.
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.
I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues, a lot of legislators about these issues.
When legislators and others think about economic development, what they first of all think about are business tax incentives, property tax abatements, job creation tax credits, you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.
So for example, states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
Now, those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions, and the way they can make sense is, by creating more and better jobs, they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.
So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks.
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing, create more and better jobs, but in a different way.
It's a somewhat more indirect way.
These programs can promote more and better jobs by, you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool, it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around, and, in turn, that higher-quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community.
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.
Okay. If you look at the research evidence -- that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment, wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults, you take those known effects, you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out, and you take research on how much skills drive job creation, you will conclude, from these three separate lines of research, that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs, the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and 78 cents, so that's a three-to-one return.
Now you can get much higher returns, of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits, if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state, but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers, and it's the states that are going to have to act.
So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development.
Now, one objection you often hear, or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is, why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children?
What's in it for me?
And the trouble with that objection, it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent.
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that there are huge spillovers of skills -- that when other people's children get more skills, that actually increases the prosperity of everyone, including people whose skills don't change.
So for example, numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas, it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages; it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically because they're low-cost.
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.
So when we invest in other people's children, and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth of a metro area.
As another example, if we look at what determines an individual's wages, and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages, we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part, on that individual's education, for example whether or not they have a college degree.
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition, we find that even once we hold constant, statistically, the effect of your own education, the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages.
So specifically, if you hold constant your education, you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area, you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all.
In fact, this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree, the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects.
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area, and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person, but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area, you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.
That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education.
Now, what's going on here?
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?
Well, let's think about it this way.
I can be the most skilled person in the world, but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills, my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology, new production techniques.
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills, if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills, my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets.
And again, the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages, and then, particularly in high-tech businesses, they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm, but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high-quality, we not only help those children, we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth.
Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out.
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus, Ohio, but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will, for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and become Wolverines.
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data, Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy, whether it's depressed or booming, it doesn't vary much over time.
So the reality is, if you invest in kids, they will stay.
Or at least, enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy.
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way, pay off in higher adult skills.
There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy, and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy, and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar, we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy.
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling.
So what are the barriers to getting it done?
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.
So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four, the total annual national cost would be roughly 30 billion dollars.
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.
On the other hand, if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million, we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person, is something that any state government can afford to do.
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.
And, of course, as I mentioned, this cost has corresponding benefits.
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three, 2.78, for the state economy, in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something, what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid, that would increase earnings by about 10 percent over their whole career, just doing the preschool, not improving K-12 or anything else after that, not doing anything with college tuition or access, just directly improving preschool, and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle-class kids.
So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits.
Now, that's one barrier.
I actually think the more profound barrier is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce, and thereby increasing economic development.
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds, we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.
So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years, and of course America is notorious for being a short term-oriented society.
Now one response you can make to this, and I sometimes have done this in talks, is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs, there are benefits, parents care about preschool, maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool, and I think those are true, but in some sense they're missing the point.
Ultimately, this is something we're investing in now for the future.
And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question.
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately not an economic question, it's a moral question: Are we willing, as Americans, are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long-term future of not only our kids, but our community?
Are we still capable of that as a country?
And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves.
Is that something that you are still invested in, that you still believe in the notion of investment?
That is the notion of investment.
You sacrifice now for a return later.
So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong.
However, the moral and political choice is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.
Thank you very much.
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect -- the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now, we've been engaged in a field called active music.
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling, I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra, or into something that nobody has ever heard before.
When we started making these, I started thinking, why can't we make wonderful instruments like that for everybody, people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments, all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music, use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound, touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in, to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna, where we built a museum around it.
And that led to something which you probably do know.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
It's very, very important.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers, Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm, and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends, who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing -- and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it, you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button, it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context, for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself, and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.
So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
So, we're working on understanding those underlying principles and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital, so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music.
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
Everybody can experience music in a profound way, we just have to make different tools.
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you, I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, perhaps deeper things.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment, actually into a series of books.
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier, but it's actually a robotic music instrument.
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings, each string is controlled with a little robotic element -- either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings, acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers, and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope, not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
The largest set piece in the opera is called The System. It's a series of books.
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound, and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls, which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared, but the whole physical environment becomes this person.
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
This is a sneak preview.
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it, another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces, as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're thinking of as personal opera.
And, if you're going to make a personal opera, what about a personal instrument?
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work, to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.
And I'd like now to invite two very special people on the stage, so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan, thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that, because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
Dan Ellsey: Hello. My name is Dan Ellsey. I am 34 years old and I have cerebral palsy.
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software.
Tod Machover: And we're really excited to have you here, really Dan.
So we met Dan about three years ago, three and a half years ago, when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic, did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.
He's very shy, too.
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area -- mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan be able easily to make his own pieces, but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music.
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to with his speaking controller.
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know, the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking; in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
But, then was the really interesting aspect of the work, following the engineering part, where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?
What types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music?
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies -- they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know, with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.
And so that's what we'll do today.
TM: So let's do it. So Dan do you want to tell everyone about what you're going to play now?
DE: This is "My Eagle Song."
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece, completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.
TM: He's really modest, too.
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.
He can place those exactly where he wants.
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window, draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore, you can see it also, you can see where the sections are, something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end up with a big bang at the end.
So that's the way he made his piece, and as Adam says, we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements, it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
So, are we ready Adam?
Yeah.
TM: OK, now Dan will play his piece "My Eagle Song" for you.
TM: Bravo.
This is the venue where, as a young man, some of the music that I wrote was first performed.
It was, remarkably, a pretty good sounding room.
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere, it actually sounded pretty good.
This is a song that was recorded there.
This is not Talking Heads, in the picture anyway.
" by Talking Heads) So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood.
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.
The sound system was kind of decent.
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too, pretty concise.
Other places around the country had similar rooms.
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
The music was in some ways different, but in structure and form, very much the same.
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.
And so the bands at Tootsie's or at CBGB's had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down, shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing.
Since then, I've played other places that are much nicer.
I've played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that.
And it's been very exciting.
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written, or was writing at the time, didn't sound all that great in some of those halls.
We managed, but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made.
So I asked myself: Do I write stuff for specific rooms?
Do I have a place, a venue, in mind when I write?
Is that a kind of model for creativity?
Do we all make things with a venue, a context, in mind?
Okay, Africa.
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa.
And the music there, I would say, the instruments, the intricate rhythms, the way it's played, the setting, the context, it's all perfect. It all works perfect.
The music works perfectly in that setting.
There's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
It's no accident.
It's perfect for that particular context.
And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
It doesn't change key, the notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music.
It actually improves it.
This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral, so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.
He can, very innovatively, actually change keys without risking huge dissonances.
This is a little bit later.
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.
They're smaller, even less reverberant, so he can write really frilly music that's very intricate -- and it works.
It fits the room perfectly.
This is La Scala.
It's around the same time, I think it was built around 1776.
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built, they used to yell out to one another.
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
If they liked an aria, they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore, not at the end of the show, but immediately.
And well, that was an opera experience.
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
And the size of the room is not that big.
It's smaller than this.
But Wagner made an innovation.
He wanted a bigger band.
He wanted a little more bombast, so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there.
Okay.
This is Carnegie Hall.
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.
And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala.
Around the same, according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker, this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage, or gossiping with one another during the show.
They had to be very quiet.
So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls.
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics, which there weren't in some of these other kinds of music.
Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting.
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall, the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural.
This is Mahler.
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
That was Bob's last record, yeah.
Popular music, coming along at the same time.
This is a jazz band.
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs.
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked.
And they'd say, "Play that part again."
Well, there's only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.
And a new form of music was born.
These are played mainly in small rooms.
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.
So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that.
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music, whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century, when this became one of the primary venues for music.
And this was one way that the music got there.
Microphones enabled singers, in particular, and musicians and composers, to completely change the kind of music that they were writing.
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music, but singers, like Frank Sinatra, could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone.
Other singers after him went even further.
This is Chet Baker.
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone.
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.
And he's singing right into your ear.
He's whispering into your ears.
The effect is just electric.
It's like the guy is sitting next to you, whispering who knows what into your ear.
So at this point, music diverged.
There's live music, and there's recorded music.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque, and there's jukeboxes in bars, where you don't even need to have a band.
There doesn't need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever, and the sound systems are good.
People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems.
And, as with jazz, the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others.
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.
The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.
And another new form of music was born.
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful, ended up in what is probably, acoustically, the worst sounding venues on the planet: sports stadiums, basketball arenas and hockey arenas.
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.
They wrote what is now called arena rock, which is medium-speed ballads.
They did the best they could given that this is what they're writing for.
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.
It's more a social situation than a musical situation.
And in some ways, the music that they're writing for this place works perfectly.
So there's more new venues.
One of the new ones is the automobile.
I grew up with a radio in a car.
But now that's evolved into something else.
The car is a whole venue.
The music that, I would say, is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it.
It might not be what you want to listen to at home, but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum, you know, big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.
There's one other kind of new venue, the private MP3 player.
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall, or when the audience had to hush up, because you can now hear every single detail.
In other ways, it's more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet, you turn it up, and the next minute, your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
So that doesn't really work.
I think pop music, mainly, it's written today, to some extent, is written for these kind of players, for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail, but the dynamic doesn't change that much.
So I asked myself: Okay, is this a model for creation, this adaptation that we do?
And does it happen anywhere else?
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people, birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy, where the foliage is dense, their calls tend to be high-pitched, short and repetitive.
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls, so that they don't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor.
And birds like this Savannah sparrow, they tend to have a buzzing type call.
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs.
Other birds, like this tanager, have adapted within the same species.
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States, where the forests are a little denser, has one kind of call, and the tananger on the other side, on the west has a different kind of call.
So birds do it too.
And I thought: Well, if this is a model for creation, if we make music, primarily the form at least, to fit these contexts, and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls, and if we write software to fit existing operating systems, is that how it works?
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.
It's adaptive.
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there.
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view.
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion, and then somehow it gets shaped into something.
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first.
We already know where that passion is going.
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.
The writer, Thomas Frank, says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests, that voters, like a lot of us, assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere, that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate, that it's more authentic.
And they'll vote for that.
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity, if they can fake passion, they stand a better chance of being selected in that way, which seems a little dangerous.
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy, are not mutually exclusive.
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds.
We adapt.
We sing.
And like the birds, the joy is still there, even though we have changed what we do to fit the context.
Thank you very much.
For a long time in my life, I felt like I'd been living two different lives.
There's the life that everyone sees, and then there's the life that only I see.
And in the life that everyone sees, who I am is a friend, a son, a brother, a stand-up comedian and a teenager.
That's the life everyone sees.
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me, that's what they would tell you.
And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.
And if you were to ask me to describe myself, I'd probably say some of those same things.
And I wouldn't be lying, but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either, because the truth is, that's just the life everyone else sees.
In the life that only I see, who I am, who I really am, is someone who struggles intensely with depression.
I have for the last six years of my life, and I continue to every day.
Now, for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn't really know what that means, that might surprise them to hear, because there's this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong, when you break up with your girlfriend, when you lose a loved one, when you don't get the job you wanted.
But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.
That's a natural human emotion.
Real depression isn't being sad when something in your life goes wrong.
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right.
That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.
And to be totally honest, that's hard for me to stand up here and say.
It's hard for me to talk about, and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about, so much so that no one's talking about it.
And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be, because right now it's a massive problem.
It's a massive problem.
But we don't see it on social media, right?
We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.
We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy, it's not fun, it's not light.
And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this: every 30 seconds, every 30 seconds, somewhere, someone in the world takes their own life because of depression, and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away, it might be two continents away, but it's happening, and it's happening every single day.
And we have a tendency, as a society, to look at that and go, "So what?"
So what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.
That's their problem."
We say we're sad and we say we're sorry, but we also say, "So what?"
Well, two years ago it was my problem, because I sat on the edge of my bed where I'd sat a million times before and I was suicidal.
I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface, you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.
You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team, the drama and theater student of the year, the English student of the year, someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party.
So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.
You would be wrong. So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it.
I came this close to doing it.
And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones, one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump, one of the lucky ones who survives.
Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story, and my story is this: In four simple words, I suffer from depression.
I suffer from depression, and for a long time, I think, I was living two totally different lives, where one person was always afraid of the other.
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was, that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was, that beneath my smile, there was struggle, and beneath my light, there was dark, and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.
See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.
Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.
But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.
I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability, and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner, like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out, and so I thought about that way every single day.
I thought about it every single day, and if I'm being totally honest, standing here I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness, that's the struggle, that's depression, and depression isn't chicken pox.
You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.
It's something you live with. It's something you live in.
It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.
It's the feelings you can't seem to escape, the scariest part is that after a while, you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you, and what you really fear the most isn't the suffering inside of you.
It's the stigma inside of others, it's the shame, it's the embarrassment, it's the disapproving look on a friend's face, it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak, it's the comments that you're crazy.
That's what keeps you from getting help.
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it, and you hold it in and you hide it, and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it, you hide it, because the stigma in our society around depression is very real.
It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this: Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you're having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you're depressed?
That's the stigma, because unfortunately, we live in a world where if you break your arm, everyone runs over to sign your cast, but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.
That's the stigma.
We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains. And that's ignorance.
That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created a world that doesn't understand depression, that doesn't understand mental health.
And that's ironic to me, because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world, yet it's one of the least discussed.
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.
Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to, because that's wishful thinking, and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination, and we can't procrastinate on something this important.
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one.
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
And I don't know what the solution is.
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.
It has to start with me, it has to start with you, it has to start with the people who are suffering, the ones who are hidden in the shadows.
We need to speak up and shatter the silence.
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in, because if there's one thing that I've come to realize, if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem, it's not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others.
It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves, where we're okay with who we are, because when we get honest, we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.
Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else, we all know what it is to hurt.
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart, and we all know how important it is to heal.
But right now, depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.
And know that you're sick, you're not weak, and it's an issue, not an identity, because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others, you can see depression for what it really is, and that's just a part of life, just a part of life, and as much as I hate, as much as I hate some of the places, some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to, in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.
Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys, but only to show me there's peaks, and yeah it's dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light.
My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet, has given me perspective, and my hurt, my hurt has forced me to have hope, have hope and to have faith, faith in myself, faith in others, faith that it can get better, that we can change this, that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance, fight back against intolerance, and more than anything, learn to love ourselves, learn to accept ourselves for who we are, the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.
The world I believe in is one where we're measured by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say, "I'm going through hell," and they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay, and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.
We're people, and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness, then I'm here to tell you you're wrong.
You're wrong, because it's the opposite.
We're people, and we have problems.
We're not perfect, and that's okay.
So we need to stop the ignorance, stop the intolerance, stop the stigma, and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos, take a look at the truth, and start talking, because the only way we're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together, by standing strong together.
And I believe that we can.
I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.
This is a dream come true. Thank you.
Thank you.
On March 14, this year, I posted this poster on Facebook.
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag.
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted.
A few days ago, I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store, and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other, and the owner was explaining to the client that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now, and we have people, you know, afraid.
It's like every year it's the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran.
It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever, for 10 years now.
So at some point it became, you know, to me, I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before.
Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook, my friends like it, don't like it, most of the time don't like it, don't share it, don't nothing, and it's another day.
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
And later on in the night, I woke up because I'm always waking up in the night, and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots, you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
And I was like, "What's going on?"
So I come to the computer and I start looking on, and suddenly I see many people talking to me, most of them I don't know, and a few of them from Iran, which is -- What?
Because you have to understand, in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.
We don't know people from Iran.
It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from -- it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.
And now people from Iran are talking to me.
So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come, because they don't have a computer, she asked her family to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
So I'm like, whoa.
I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.
People are crying, and she came, she read the text, and she started to cry.
And everybody's crying now.
So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex, as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody what I'd just seen, and people started to see them and to share them, and that's how it started.
The day after, when really it became a lot of talking, I said to myself, and my wife said to me, I also want a poster, so this is her.
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.
But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work, but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel who want to say something.
So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want, and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.
And that's how it started. And that's how, really, it's unleashed, because suddenly people from Facebook, friends and others, just understand that they can be part of it.
It's not just one dude making one poster, it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures and ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.
I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends to come, graphic designers most of them, to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.
It was a huge amount of pictures.
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images.
If it's an image, they may read it.
So here are a few of them.
This one is really moving for me because it's the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning, and now that she sees the posters that we're sending, she starts -- she said that she changed her mind, and now she loves that blue, she loves that star, and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag, and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another, and just a few days after I posted the first poster.
The day after, Iranians started to respond with their own posters.
They have graphic designers. What?
Crazy, crazy.
So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces, but they want to spread the message.
They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
So. And now it's communication.
It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians sending the same message, one to each other.
This never happened before, and this is two people supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war, and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say, "I like this guy. I love those guys."
And it became really big at some point.
And then it became news.
Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
And suddenly, there is something that was happening that was good news. So the guys on the news, they say, "Okay, let's talk about this."
And they just came, and it was so much, I remember one day, Michal, she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him, "Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."
So she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?
Who is everybody?""Everybody."
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."
"Lebanon?""Lebanon."
At some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.
It's everybody." The Chinese.
And we were just at the beginning of the story.
Something crazy also happened.
Every time a country started talking about it, like Germany, America, wherever, a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories, so at the beginning we had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message, to people sending their love, one to each other.
The moment I really understood that something was happening, a friend of mine told me, "Google the word 'Israel.'" And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."
We really changed how people see the Middle East.
Because you're not in the Middle East.
You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East, so you go on Google and you say, "Israel," and they give you the bad stuff.
And for a few days you got those images.
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know, commented on one of the photos.
So for five months now, that's what we are doing, me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.
We're showing a new reality by just making images because that's how the world perceives us.
They see images of us, and they see bad images.
So we're working on making good images. End of story.
Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.
This is the enemy.
What?
And it's going both ways.
It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.
And you become friends.
And at some point, you become friends on Facebook, and you become friends in life.
You can go and travel and meet people.
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe, I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland, from Germany," of course, and from Israel people came, and we just met there for the first time in real life.
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time. And we just shake hands, and have a coffee and a nice discussion, and we talk about food and basketball.
And that was the end of it.
Remember that image from the beginning?
At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.
And it goes the other way around.
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran, lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us, decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel, and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says, "Okay, not that big a deal."
So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher, so we start this new campaign called "Not ready to die in your war."
I mean, it's plus/minus the same message, but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.
And again, something amazing happened, something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.
Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent, you know, their foot and half their faces, now they're sending their faces, and they're saying, "Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."
Just read where those guys are from.
And for every guy from Israel, you've got someone from Iran.
Just people sending their pictures.
Crazy, yes?
So -- So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli, I'm a father of two, I'm a husband, and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but, this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — " I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years, and I know how it looks from the ground.
I know how it can look really bad.
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes, but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
Maybe as people, because especially in Israel, we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech, and maybe that little thing can change something.
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.
We can just send a message and hope for the best.
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images.
And maybe that image will help us change something.
Just raise that. Exactly.
And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.
Oh my God.
Don't cry.
Thank you guys.
Let's talk trash.
You know, we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime.
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
Mental note to the liberators: throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
Plastics are also hard to recycle.
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream.
It's diddly-point-squat.
That's the percentage we recycle.
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge.
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash.
A large, unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea.
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.
In spite of deposit fees, much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes, here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan, who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California.
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET, will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic, polypropylene.
They will float in seawater, but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo.
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific, while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch, while ours litter the Philippines.
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre.
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks.
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach.
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish, like cigarette lighters ...
but, mostly bottle caps.
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface.
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals.
This is Mae West, still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem, so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.
I got plenty of takers.
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags, they shook my hand.
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton.
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this.
And this.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this.
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach, the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes, from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean, at the base of the food chain, was ingesting these poison pills.
We did hundreds of necropsies, and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long, had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
We have to throw it away.
Now, the market can do a lot for us, but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
Narrator : The levels are increasing, the amount of packaging is increasing, the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating, and it's showing up in the ocean.
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world, he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline, in Long Beach, California.
Charles Moore: Thank you.
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time, there is going to be food there waiting for us, having magically come from somewhere.
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London, enough food has to be produced, transported, bought and sold, cooked, eaten, disposed of, and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth, it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
We live in places like this as if they're the most natural things in the world, forgetting that because we're animals and that we need to eat, we're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities, more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes, but few of us ever get to see them.
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities, more of us are eating meat, so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first, that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
And it's an escalating problem too.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed, by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are, it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost, we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process, we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations, it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future, it's an unsustainable diet.
So how did we get here?
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first, about 10,000 years ago, I would say, is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East, known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago, that two extraordinary inventions, agriculture and urbanism, happened roughly in the same place and at the same time.
This is no accident, because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like, we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur, that were, in fact, effectively, spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest, gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods, and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like, the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
Basically, Rome had access to the sea, which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world, because it was very difficult to transport food over roads, which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long, drawn out militarized shopping spree, really.
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this: Rome in fact used to import oysters from London, at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century, we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames, along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside, which was the main market, were also grain markets.
And if you look at the name of one of those streets, Bread Street, you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market, operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
This is another thing about food in cities: Once its roots into the city are established, they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat was coming from the northwest, from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest, which is why Smithfield, London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway, and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside, that's where they were sold, which is why it's called Poultry.
And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age, you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food, both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life, is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold.
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch, the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city, part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind, somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities, really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
And as you can see from these maps of London, in the 90 years after the trains came, it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot, and so on, to a large splurge, that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot, either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars, and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell, devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people, because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars, drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts, came back with a week's worth of shopping, and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship, both with food and cities, changes completely.
Here we have food -- that used to be the center, the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place, they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship, which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver, that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
So what are we going to do about that?
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states, if that sounds remotely familiar, a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad, and grew vegetables in their back gardens, and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia, even though More never framed it that way.
And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision, that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states, little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around, joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas, that they are Utopian.
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling, that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative, which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek, "sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
I believe we already live in Sitopia.
We live in a world shaped by food, and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- it's food at the center of life, at the center of family life, being celebrated, being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food, who think ahead, who plan, who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place, food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape, and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up, to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this, as part of the productive, organic framework of which they are inevitably a part, symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either, because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country, the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now, what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask, and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer's Hill where I used to go and spend hours going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I've got over.
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan, actually, for me.
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby, thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.
Thank you very much.
Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer's Hill? Those summer nights, so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer's Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Have the years been kind? And do you think of me sometimes up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Oh, I pray you one day will We won't say a word We won't need them Sometimes silence is best We'll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Do you think of me sometimes? And do you ever make that climb? Where are you now? My wild summer love Where are you now? Have the years been kind? And do you ever make that climb up on Kiteflyer's Hill? Kiteflyer's ... [French] Where are you? Where are you now? Where are you now? Kiteflyer's ... Gracias. Thank you very much.
I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look.
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream.
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces.
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and the interiors were completely out of sync with that.
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin.
That seemed really like a crisis to me, that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape, and about travel, and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer, and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell.
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard, we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in.
The main goal was to smooth out the interior, and begin to speak about motion, and mobility, and independence.
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer.
There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.
So that became a challenge.
Compounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight, only bends in two dimensions.
It's a compound curve interior.
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell.
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell.
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space, so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way, and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin, so they function as an electrical chase.
That's the trailer, pretty much finished.
That trailer led to another commission, to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.
He said one he would like to make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States, that would collect records and go on tours.
This trailer housed two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people, and basically we'd had a great time with this.
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel, and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream.
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.
They came to me and said, "Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers, rock climbers, would use these things?"
And I said, "Well, not in that interior."
Anyway, I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype.
I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding."
And I walked in their prototype facility, and it's exactly like my shop, only bigger -- same tools, same things.
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology, and there's no money for tooling or molding.
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely, so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers, you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist, so I put children to sleep for a living.
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.
And it's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning, that pain is a disease.
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time.
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation.
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists.
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease.
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now.
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this.
Please keep your seat.
A very different feeling.
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather, but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.
In fact, imagine something even worse.
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather, and their brain [was] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch.
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler, whom you see in the photograph.
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.
She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer.
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life.
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story.
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color.
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that.
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands, to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow, almost all the way to her shoulder.
But the worst part was, not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.
The worst part was that she had allodynia, the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch.
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand, the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on -- caused excruciating, burning pain.
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame?
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house.
In your house, wires run in the wall, from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb.
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.
If you hit your thumb with a hammer, these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires, new nerves, take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.
But the situation, of course, in the human body is far more complicated than that.
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion, in fact, what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells.
These cells, called glial cells, were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together, like the nerves.
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation, amplification and, in the case of pain, the distortion of sensory experiences.
These glial cells become activated.
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins, which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves, and they start releasing their neurotransmitters, and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth, until what we have is a positive feedback loop.
It's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch, the toilet flushed three doors down, or your dishwasher went on, or your computer monitor turned off.
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain.
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.
The nervous system has plasticity.
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli.
Well, what do we do about that?
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time.
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are, frankly, not very effective for this kind of pain.
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet, and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.
And most importantly, what we do is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life.
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency, despair and depression that always accompanies severe, chronic pain.
It's successful, as you can see from this video of Chandler, who, two months after we first met her, is now doings a back flip.
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here, and she's doing absolutely fantastic.
But the future is actually even brighter.
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem, as we have now, but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells, or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate, that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up, or plasticity, that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain.
So I have hope that in the future, the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized, who said, "My philosophy: No pain, no pain."
Thank you very much.

Today I'm going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep, so dark, so unexplored that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
It's a place of myth and legend.
It's a place marked on ancient maps as "here be monsters."
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
Instead, they just make me green with envy that my colleague from IUCN was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
We are talking about the high seas.
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage to cast light on some of the outdated myths and legends and assumptions that have kept us as the true stakeholders in the high seas in the dark.
We're going to voyage to some of these special places that we've been discovering in the past few years to show why we really need to care.
And then finally, we're going to try to develop and pioneer a new perspective on high seas governance that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation, but framed in an arena of global norms of precaution and respect.
So here is a picture of the high seas as seen from above -- that area in the darker blue.
To me, as an international lawyer, this scared me far more than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen, for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean, the global ocean, that provides us all with carbon storage, with heat storage, with oxygen, if you can only protect 36 percent.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
Some of the problems that we have to confront are that the current international laws -- for example, shipping -- provide more protection to the areas closest to shore.
For example, garbage discharge, something you would think just simply goes away, but the laws regulating ship discharge of garbage actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
As a result, we have garbage patches the size of twice-Texas.
It's unbelievable.
We used to think the solution to pollution was dilution, but that has proved to be no longer the case.
So what we have learned from social scientists and economists like Elinor Ostrom, who are studying the phenomenon of management of the commons on a local scale, is that there are certain prerequisites that you can put into place that enable you to manage and access open space for the good of one and all.
And these include a sense of shared responsibility, common norms that bind people together as a community.
Conditional access: You can invite people in, but they have to be able to play by the rules.
And of course, if you want people to play by the rules, you still need an effective system of monitoring and enforcement, for as we've discovered, you can trust, but you also need to verify.
What I'd also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas.
For a group of very dedicated individuals -- scientists, conservationists, photographers and states -- were able to actually change a tragic trajectory that was destroying fragile seascapes such as this coral garden that you see in front of you.
That is, we're able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling.
And how did we do that?
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships and actually photographed the activities in process.
But we also spent many hours in the basements of the United Nations, trying to work with governments to make them understand what was going on so far away from land that few of us had ever even imagined that these creatures existed.
So within three years, from 2003 to 2006, we were able to get norm in place that actually changed the paradigm of how fishers went about deep-sea bottom trawling.
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want," we actually created a regime that required prior assessment of where you're going and a duty to prevent significant harm.
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress, they discovered that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed had been protected.
This does not mean that it's the final solution, or that this even provides permanent protection.
But what it does mean is that a group of individuals can form a community to actually shape the way high seas are governed, to create a new regime.
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities for creating a true, blue perspective for this beautiful planet.
Sylvia's wish provides us with that leverage, that access to the heart of human beings, you might say, who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes, but are now hopefully going to become interested in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles, who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling of some of these special areas, just to give you an idea of the flavor of the riches and wonders they do contain.
The Sargasso Sea, for example, is not a sea bounded by coastlines, but it is bounded by oceanic currents that contain and envelope this wealth of sargassum that grows and aggregates there.
It's also known as the spawning ground for eels from Northern European and Northern American rivers that are now so dwindling in numbers that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm, and five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
But the Sargasso Sea, the same way it aggregates sargassum weed, actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region.
This picture doesn't exactly show the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
But there has just been a study that was released in February that showed there are 200,000 pieces of plastic per square-kilometer now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea, and that is affecting the habitat for the many species in their juvenile stages who come to the Sargasso Sea for its protection and its food.
The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place for the aggregation of these unique species that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
It also provides a special habitat for these flying fish to lay their eggs.
But what I'd like to get from this picture is that we truly do have an opportunity to launch a global initiative for protection.
Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need and its responsibility as having some of the Sargasso Sea within its national jurisdiction -- but the vast majority is beyond -- to help spearhead a movement to achieve protection for this vital area.
Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now: the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
It's actually a bay.
It's considered high seas, because the continent has been put off limits to territorial claims.
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
But what makes the Ross Sea important is the vast sea of pack ice that in the spring and summer provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill that supports what, till recently, has been a virtually intact near-shore ecosystem.
But unfortunately, CCAMLR, the regional commission in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks and other living marine resources, is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests and has authorized the expansion of toothfish fisheries in the region.
The captain of a New Zealand vessel who was just down there is reporting a significant decline in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales, who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish as their main source of food.
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly, singly and together, to push governments, to push regional fisheries management organizations, to declare our right to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing, so that the freedom to fish no longer means the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome is a recently discovered area -- potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
There's enough food there to last them the summer and the winter long.
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
It's an oceanographic phenomenon that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.
Getting closer to shore, where we are, this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
Many species are headed through this region, which is why there's been so much attention put into conservation of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
This is the initiative that's been coordinated by Conservation International with a variety of partners and governments to actually try to bring integrated management regime throughout the area.
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go with a real regional initiative.
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention does not recognize the need to protect areas beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome could not technically qualify the time it's in the high seas.
So what we've been suggesting is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention, so that it can adopt and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites, or we need to change the name and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre, where they spend most of their time and often end up getting hooked like this, or as bycatch.
So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
We need to work locally, but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
We have the tools and technologies now to enable us to take a broader ocean-basin-wide initiative.
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project, one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
It's provided us data like this, of tiny, little sooty shearwaters that make the entire ocean basin their home.
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
And its culminating year that's going to be launched in October.
So stay tuned for further information.
What I find so exciting is that the Census of Marine Life has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators; it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column, where creatures like this flying sea cucumber have been found.
And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN, to team up with the Census of Marine Life and many of the scientists working there to actually try to translate much of this information to policymakers.
We have the support of governments now behind us.
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information to move ahead to protect some of these significant hope spots, hotspots.
At the same time we're saying, "Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."
But many of you have said, if you get these marine protected areas, or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place, how are you going to enforce it?
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science, which is outer space technology.
I wanted to be an astronaut, so I've constantly followed what are the tools available to monitor Earth from outer space -- and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about, in terms of being able to follow tagged species throughout their life-cycles in the open ocean.
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
Many already have transponders on board that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
It does not take too much rocket science to actually try to create new laws to mandate, if you're going to have the privilege of accessing our high seas resources, we need to know -- someone needs to know -- where you are and what you're doing.
So it brings me to my main take-home message, which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
We can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas.
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
We need to change how we actually go about managing these resources.
We need to get the new paradigm of precaution and respect.
At the same time, we need to think locally, which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish, is that we can shine a spotlight on many of these previously unknown areas, and to bring people to the table, if you will, to actually make them feel part of this community that truly has a stake in their future management.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
Many of the deep-sea communities have genetic distribution that goes ocean-basin-wide.
We need to better understand, but we also need to start to manage and protect.
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
Thank you.
I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea.
Actually, it's a really big idea.
But to get us started, I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world.
Now I bet, in this audience, you're thinking of some really incredible technology, some stuff that I haven't even heard of, I'm absolutely sure.
But I'm also sure, pretty sure, that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.
This is a polio vaccine.
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted.
This is a great technology.
We can take it completely for granted.
But it wasn't always that way.
Even here in California, if we were to go back just a few years, it was a very different story.
People were terrified of this disease.
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.
And it was because of scenes like this.
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung.
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before, and then two days later, they can no longer breathe, and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs, but also their breathing muscles.
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually, in this iron lung to breathe for them.
This disease was terrifying.
There was no cure, and there was no vaccine.
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it.
Twenty years later, they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine.
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s.
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease, and here in the United States it had an incredible impact.
As you can see, the virus stopped, and it stopped very, very fast.
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world.
And it happened so fast in the United States, however, that even just last month Jon Stewart said this: Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.
But the reality is that polio still exists today.
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
This is the picture.
There's not very much left in the world.
But the reason there's not very much left is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership working behind the scenes, almost unknown, I'm sure to most of you here today.
It's been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease, and it's got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic.
But just last year, we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn't good enough with a virus like polio.
And this is the reason: in two countries that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade, on opposite sides of the globe, there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults.
And in both cases, we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses, and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.
They had come from thousands of miles away.
And in one case, it originated on another continent.
And not only that, but when they came into these countries, then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia, where, for the first time in over a decade last year, children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years.
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you, these are under control now, and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.
But the message was very clear.
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease.
It's just happening in another part of the world.
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis.
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership, is trying to do.
We're not trying to control polio.
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases, because this disease is like a root fire; it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.
So what we're looking for is a permanent solution.
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys, can take for granted a polio-free world.
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
This virus can only survive in people.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely.
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth.
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases.
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once.
And this is because disease eradication, it's still the venture capital of public health.
The risks are massive, but the pay-off -- economic, humanitarian, motivational -- it's absolutely huge.
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs.
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone.
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
But smallpox eradication was hard; it was very, very hard.
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher, and there's a few reasons for that.
The first is that, when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago, more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox.
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries.
So it was a massive effort.
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash.
So you could get around the disease; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
With polio it's almost completely different.
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease.
So you can't see the enemy most of the time, and as a result, we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox.
We've had to create one of the largest social movements in history.
There's over 10 million people, probably 20 million people, largely volunteers, who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.
These people, these 20 million people, vaccinate over 500 million children every single year, multiple times at the peak of our operation.
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.
It's just two drops, like that.
But reaching 500 million people is much, much tougher.
And these vaccinators, these volunteers, they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest, densest urban slums in the world.
They've got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.
And they also have to dodge bullets, because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children, even in areas affected by conflict.
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio, not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.
He was sitting outside of the road, watching one of these polio campaigns unfold, and a few months later he wrote: "This is foreign aid at its most heroic."
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life, all sorts of backgrounds.
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years.
They're right at the center of the whole thing.
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years, much longer than it should have -- but once it was built, the results were striking.
Within a couple of years, every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses, with the exception of four countries that you see here.
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.
And then, by 1999, one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept.
And then today, there's been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.
When we started, over 20 years ago, 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus.
Last year, it was 1,000.
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
It's also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots, giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns.
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us, the international community, to reach every single child, every single community, the most vulnerable people in the world, with the most basic of health services, irrespective of geography, poverty, culture and even conflict.
So things were looking very exciting, and then about five years ago, this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to.
Now at that time, there was a great, as you can imagine, frustration -- let's call it frustration -- it started to grow very, very quickly.
And all of a sudden, some very important voices in the world of public health started to say, "Hang on.
We should abandon this idea of eradication.
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds, it's a false premise.
The brutal truth is, if we don't have the will or the skill, or even the money that we need to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world, with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine, then pretty soon, more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year.
There's absolutely no question.
These are children like Umar.
Umar is seven years old, and he's from northern Nigeria.
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters.
Umar also has polio.
Umar was paralyzed for life.
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004.
This leg, his right leg, now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl, because it's faster to move that way to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters, than to get up on his crutches and walk.
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.
As you probably can't see the detail here, but this is his report card, and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.
He got 100 percent in all the important things, like nursery rhymes, for example there.
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days, but it's not true.
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances.
The reality of polio today is something very different.
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.
It leaves their children paralyzed, and it drags their families deeper into poverty, because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have, trying in vain to find a cure for their children.
We think children deserve better.
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago, when people were saying, "We should call it off," the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions, new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again.
In northern India, we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this, so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters, so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services.
In northern Nigeria, the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders, they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence.
And now they've even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices, little GIS trackers like this, which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.
And then they can track them, and at the end of the day, they look and see, did these guys get every single street, every single house.
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches -- access negotiators.
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child.
But as we tried these extraordinary things, as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics, we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine, so that when they finally get to these kids, we can have a better bang for our buck.
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world.
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this.
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world.
And we didn't start with the easy places.
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan, because it's in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this.
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days, I've seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible.
So this morning at about seven o'clock, I decided that we'd try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again, so that you could see something that's just unfolding today, which proves that the impossible is possible.
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio.
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month.
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have.
And yet, the impossible is happening.
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history, not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.
India's not unique.
In Umar's home country of Nigeria, a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.
And in the last six months, we've had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history.
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination of smart people, smart technology and smart investments, polio can now be eradicated anywhere.
We have major challenges, you can imagine, to finish this job, but as you've also seen, it's doable, it has great secondary benefits, and polio eradication is a great buy.
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus, it's a stark reminder that we are failing, as a society, to reach children with the most basic of services.
And for that reason, polio eradication: it's the ultimate in equity and it's the ultimate in social justice.
The huge social movement that's been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children.
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm, capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago.
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do, and it's the right thing to do.
Now we're in tough times economically.
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio, "There's never a wrong time to do the right thing."
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do.
And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years.
We have a new vaccine, we have new resolve, and we have new tactics.
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history.
But if we blink now, we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now.
Help us tell the story.
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child, every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever.
Thank you.
Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?
B The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped -- northern Nigeria, northern India, the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they're going to be the toughest.
But the interesting thing is, of those three, India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly.
It keeps getting reinfected.
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished.
They're going to be the tough ones.
Now what about the money?
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.
And is it easy to raise that money?
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years?
B It's interesting.
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year.
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20, 30 cents to reach a child -- that's not very much money.
But right now we don't have enough of that.
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners, and every time we cut corners, more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.
Well, hopefully we'll get the word out, and the governments will keep their generosity up.
So good luck. We're all in this with you.
Thank you.

Hi, my name is Frank, and I collect secrets.
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004.
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards, just like this.
They were blank on one side, and on the other side I listed some simple instructions.
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they'd never told anyone before.
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington, D.C., not knowing what to expect.
But soon the idea began spreading virally.
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards.
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox, not just with postmarks from Washington, D.C., but from Texas, California, Vancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.
Soon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.
And this is my postcard collection today.
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.
What I'd like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection, starting with this one.
"I found these stamps as a child, and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to.
I never did have someone."
Secrets can take many forms.
They can be shocking or silly or soulful.
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet.
Maybe one of you sent this one in.
I don't know.
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard.
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side.
"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
I've found love. I'm happy."
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas, of frailty and heroism, playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now.
"Everyone who knew me before 9/11 believes I'm dead."
"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people, so sometimes I didn't wear panties, and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students.
And sometimes afterwards I'll stick around and sign books and take photos with students.
And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos.
And I should also mention that, just like today, at that PostSecret event, I was using a wireless microphone.
"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.
We all heard you pee."
This was really embarrassing when it happened, until I realized it could have been worse.
Right. You know what I'm saying.
"Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn't use.
I feel like the happiest person on Earth " "One of these men is the father of my son.
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
"That Saturday when you wondered where I was, well, I was getting your ring.
It's in my pocket right now."
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine's Day.
It was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
And it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard.
And he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you this story that just played out in my life."
He said, "My knees are still shaking."
He said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I, we've made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud.
I read some to her, she reads some to me."
He says, "It's really brought us closer together through the years.
And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom, I was beside myself.
And I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
And just like every Sunday, we started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
He said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one."
But she finally did.
She got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.
And he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."
And she turned to him and said, "Is that our cat?"
And when she saw him, he was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
He popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.
So I emailed him back and I said, "Please share with me an image, something, that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending."
And he emailed me this picture.
"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
I finally got the pictures developed and I'd love to give them to you."
This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it, but this secret has impacted many lives, starting with a student up in Canada named Matty.
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website, a website called IFoundYourCamera.
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they've found, memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos.
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week.
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they've lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for.
This one's my favorite.
Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers.
And it might seem like a simple idea, and it is, but the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture.
"That's me, my husband and son.
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.
Thank you for making your site.
These pictures mean more to me than you know.
My son's birth is on this camera.
He turns four tomorrow."
Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans, sometimes going through language barriers.
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today.
"When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again."
When I posted this secret, dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones, sometimes ones they'd been keeping for years, messages from family or friends who had died.
They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them, it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother.
Secrets can take many forms.
They can be shocking or silly or soulful.
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we'll never meet again.
Voicemail recording: First saved voice message.
It's somebody's birthday today Somebody's birthday today The candles are lighted on somebody's cake And we're all invited for somebody's sake You're 21 years old today.
Have a real happy birthday, and I love you.
I'll say bye for now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Frank, that was beautiful, so touching.
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret?
I have one of my own secrets in every book.
I think in some ways, the reason I started the project, even though I didn't know it at the time, was because I was struggling with my own secrets.
And it was through crowd-sourcing, it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me, that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me.
And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book?
Has anyone in your life been able to tell?
Sometimes I share that information, yeah.
I grew up in New York City, between Harlem and the Bronx.
Growing up as a boy, we were taught that men had to be tough, had to be strong, had to be courageous, dominating -- no pain, no emotions, with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear; that men are in charge, which means women are not; that men lead, and you should just follow and do what we say; that men are superior; women are inferior; that men are strong; women are weak; that women are of less value, property of men, and objects, particularly sexual objects.
I've later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men, better known as the "man box."
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man.
Now I also want to say, without a doubt, there are some wonderful, wonderful, absolutely wonderful things about being a man.
But at the same time, there's some stuff that's just straight up twisted, and we really need to begin to challenge, look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing, redefining, what we come to know as manhood.
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
They're 11 and 12.
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I, we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom: Kendall and Jay.
And when they were about five and six, four and five, Jay could come to me, come to me crying.
It didn't matter what she was crying about, she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up, just cry, cry it out.
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her -- he'd come to me crying, it's like as soon as I would hear him cry, a clock would go off.
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds, which means, by the time he got to me, I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
Hold your head up. Look at me.
Explain to me what's wrong.
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
Why are you crying?"
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box, I would find myself saying things like, "Just go in your room.
Just go on, go on in your room.
Sit down, get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a --" what?
Like a man.
And he's five years old.
And as I grow in life, I would say to myself, "My God, what's wrong with me?
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
And I think back.
I think back to my father.
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family.
My brother, Henry, he died tragically when we were teenagers.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
We lived in the Bronx at the time, and the burial was in a place called Long Island, it was about two hours outside of the city.
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial, the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city.
And the limousine empties out.
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out, but my father and I stayed in the limousine, and no sooner than the women got out, he burst out crying.
He didn't want cry in front of me, but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city, and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
And this is a man who, 10 minutes ago, had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can't even imagine.
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me, and at the same time, he was also giving me props, lifting me up, for not crying.
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men, this fear that just has us paralyzed, holding us hostage to this man box.
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy, a football player, and I asked him, I said, "How would you feel if, in front of all the players, your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
Now I expected him to say something like, I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
No, the boy said to me -- the boy said to me, "It would destroy me."
And I said to myself, "God, if it would destroy him to be called a girl, what are we then teaching him about girls?"
It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old.
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
At this time we're living in the Bronx, and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
He was about 16 years old, and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder, "What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was a troubled kid.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
He was being raised by his grandmother.
His father wasn't on the set.
His grandmother had two jobs.
He was home alone a lot.
But I've got to tell you, we young guys, we looked up to this dude, man.
He was cool. He was fine.
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
He was having sex.
We all looked up to him.
So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
Johnny call, you go.
So I run right upstairs.
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
Because for me growing up at that time, and our relationship with this man box, "Do you want some?" meant one of two things: sex or drugs -- and we weren't doing drugs.
Now my box, my card, my man box card, was immediately in jeopardy.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
We don't talk about that as men.
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life, the first time you had sex.
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
There ain't no first time.
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
Women are objects, especially sexual objects.
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short, I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
He told me to go in his room.
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
She's 16 years old.
She's nude.
She's what I know today to be mentally ill, higher-functioning at times than others.
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
Because, while Sheila never said no, she also never said yes.
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
Folks, I'm petrified.
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room and see that I'm not doing anything, and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.
Now I say this all with remorse, and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time, but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited, because I didn't get caught.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
This fear, getting outside the man box, totally enveloped me.
It was way more important to me, about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her.
See collectively, we as men are taught to have less value in women, to view them as property and the objects of men.
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
We as men, good men, the large majority of men, we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization.
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
You see, we have to come to understand that less value, property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can't happen without it.
So we're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem.
The center for disease control says that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions, is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad.
So quickly, I'd like to just say, this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving?
I need you on board. I need you with me.
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it's okay to not be dominating, that it's okay to have feelings and emotions, that it's okay to promote equality, that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it, that it's okay to be whole, that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman.
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy, I asked a nine-year-old boy, "What would life be like for you, if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
He said to me, "I would be free."
Thank you folks.
Ten years ago, on a Tuesday morning, I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
It was a routine training jump, like many more I'd done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before.
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early.
You do some routine refresher training, and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you.
And you put on the T-10 parachute.
And you're very careful how you put the straps, particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs.
And then you put on your reserve, and then you put on your heavy rucksack.
And then a jumpmaster comes, and he's an experienced NCO in parachute operations.
He checks you out, he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed, your shoulders are crushed down, and, of course, he's tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well.
Then you sit down, and you wait a little while, because this is the Army.
Then you load the aircraft, and then you stand up and you get on, and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this, in a line of people, and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft.
And you wait a little bit longer, because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait.
Then you take off.
And it's painful enough now -- and I think it's designed this way -- it's painful enough so you want to jump.
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.
So you get in the aircraft, you're flying along, and at 20 minutes out, these jumpmasters start giving you commands.
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.
You sit there, OK.
Then they give you 10 minutes.
And of course, you're responding with all of these.
And that's to boost everybody's confidence, to show that you're not scared.
Then they give you, "Get ready."
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."
If you're an outboard personnel, now you stand up.
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.
And then you hook up, and you hook up your static line.
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?
I'm probably going to jump.
There's no way to get out of this at this point."
You go through some additional checks, and then they open the door.
And this was that Tuesday morning in September, and it was pretty nice outside.
So nice air comes flowing in.
The jumpmasters start to check the door.
And then when it's time to go, a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes, "Go."
The first guy goes, and you're just in line, and you just kind of lumber to the door.
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.
You fall outside the door, you're caught in the slipstream.
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest, your arms extended, put over your reserve parachute.
You do that because, 27 years before, an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that.
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open.
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set.
But typically you do; typically it opens.
And of course, if your leg straps aren't set right, at that point you get another little thrill.
Boom.
So then you look around, you're under a canopy and you say, "This is good."
Now you prepare for the inevitable.
You are going to hit the ground.
You can't delay that much.
And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered.
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready.
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet, your calves, your thighs, your buttocks and your push-up muscles.
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.
And that's not going to hurt.
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window.
And as soon as I hit, the first thing I did is I'd see if I'd broken anything that I needed.
I'd shake my head, and I'd ask myself the eternal question: "Why didn't I go into banking?"
And I'd look around, and then I'd see another paratrooper, a young guy or girl, and they'd have pulled out their M4 carbine and they'd be picking up their equipment.
They'd be doing everything that we had taught them.
And I realized that, if they had to go into combat, they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders.
And I realized that, if they came out of combat, it would be because we led them well.
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did.
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump, but it's not any jump -- that was September 11th, 2001.
And when we took off from the airfield, America was at peace.
When we landed on the drop-zone, everything had changed.
And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very, very real -- and leadership seemed important.
But things had changed; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general.
I'd been successful, but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes, and on that morning, I didn't know it.
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership: Robert E. Lee, John Buford at Gettysburg.
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership.
This was my father in Vietnam.
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn't lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades.
And I still believe real leaders are like that.
But in my first 25 years of career, I had a bunch of different experiences.
One of my first battalion commanders, I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march, and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds.
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.
But then a couple of years later, when I was a company commander, I went out to the National Training Center.
And we did an operation, and my company did a dawn attack -- you know, the classic dawn attack: you prepare all night, move to the line of departure.
And I had an armored organization at that point.
We move forward, and we get wiped out -- I mean, wiped out immediately.
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.
And after the battle, they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an "after action review" to teach you what you've done wrong.
Sort of leadership by humiliation.
They put a big screen up, and they take you through everything: "and then you didn't do this, and you didn't do this, etc."
I walked out feeling as low as a snake's belly in a wagon rut.
And I saw my battalion commander, because I had let him down.
And I went up to apologize to him, and he said, "Stanley, I thought you did great."
And in one sentence, he lifted me, put me back on my feet, and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure.
When 9/11 came, 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world.
First, the things that are obvious, that you're familiar with: the environment changed -- the speed, the scrutiny, the sensitivity of everything now is so fast, sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it.
But everything we do is in a different context.
More importantly, the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries.
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them, I'm now leading a force that's dispersed, and I've got to use other techniques.
I've got to use video teleconferences, I've got to use chat, I've got to use email, I've got to use phone calls -- I've got to use everything I can, not just for communication, but for leadership.
A 22-year-old individual operating alone, thousands of miles from me, has got to communicate to me with confidence.
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.
And I also have to build their faith.
And that's a new kind of leadership for me.
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations.
An emerging opportunity came -- didn't have time to get everybody together.
So we had to get complex intelligence together, we had to line up the ability to act.
It was sensitive, we had to go up the chain of command, convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium.
We failed.
The mission didn't work.
And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force, rebuild their confidence -- me and them, and them and me, and our seniors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder.
Entirely new requirement.
Also, the people had changed.
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons.
In reality, much of the force I led looked exactly like you.
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose.
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much.
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team.
We talked about the operation, and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that.
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"
And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair's tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said, "Sir, I was in the sixth grade."
And it reminded me that we're operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness, and yet he has different experiences, in many cases a different vocabulary, a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders.
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise, because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot, that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn't what the force was doing anymore.
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven't done what the people you're leading are doing?
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent, a lot more willing to listen, a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower.
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.
Then another thing.
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.
There's an impact, it's cumulative.
You don't reset, or recharge your battery every time.
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces.
And I remembered his son was in our force.
And I said, "John, where's your son? And how is he?"
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."
I said, "Where is he now?"
And he pointed at the screen, he said, "He's in that firefight."
Think about watching your brother, father, daughter, son, wife in a firefight in real time and you can't do anything about it.
Think about knowing that over time.
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.
And you have to watch and take care of each other.
I probably learned the most about relationships.
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together.
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment.
And every morning in the Ranger regiment, every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed.
You may know one line of it, it says, "I'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy."
And it's not a mindless mantra, and it's not a poem.
It's a promise.
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, "No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming."
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing.
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever.
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007, and an old friend of mine, that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note, just in an envelope, that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said, "I knew if I ever got in a tight spot, that you would come, if alive."
And having that kind of relationship, for me, turned out to be critical at many points in my career.
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment, because it's tough.
That was my journey.
I hope it's not over.
I came to believe that a leader isn't good because they're right; they're good because they're willing to learn and to trust.
This isn't easy stuff.
It's not like that electronic abs machine where, 15 minutes a month, you get washboard abs.
And it isn't always fair.
You can get knocked down, and it hurts and it leaves scars.
But if you're a leader, the people you've counted on will help you up.
And if you're a leader, the people who count on you need you on your feet.
Thank you.

So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it.
So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.
I saw. "What is that?" I asked.
My wife replied, "None of your business."
Then, being her husband, I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days.
Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.
Then I was shocked. What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
And it's called affordability.
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?
It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
"Close your eyes. Whatever I give, it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring, even a chocolate, I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
Close your eyes."
Because I tried to make it intimate.
Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
Why I am not getting [any]?
You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
They also refused. Finally, I decide, use sanitary pad myself.
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.
Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest, like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe.
I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle, I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties, while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press, doses of blood will go there.
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget -- the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
My God, it's unbelievable.
But here the problem is, one company is making napkin out of cotton. It is working well.
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
You need first funds.
Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.
Why is this? I used medical college girls.
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls.
Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material. Again, a stop-up.
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant, anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
That is my invention.
So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.
I never did this. I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating.
Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries.
Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
Play video one.
Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"
She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups.
That is my idea.
AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
They are performing puja.
: You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
I'm sustaining on seventh year.
Already 600 installations. What is my mission?
I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create.
That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
I'm doing something serious.
If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad.
I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe. That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software.
Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
Little educated, done this. Surplus educated, what are you going to do for the society?
Thank you very much. Bye!

There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.
The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from?
How did the universe come into being?
Are we alone in the universe?
Is there alien life out there?
What is the future of the human race?
Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time.
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.
This meant they must have been closer together in the past.
If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago.
This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.
But was there anything before the Big Bang?
If not, what created the universe?
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts.
First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time.
And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.
We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions.
But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.
However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct.
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.
This removes the distinction between time and space, and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.
Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states.
These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe.
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.
I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe?
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.
But we don't know how life first appeared.
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.
On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes?
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.
Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years.
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.
This brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race.
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue.
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past.
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million.
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space.
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personed -- space flight.
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge.
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress.
Thank you for listening.
Professor, if you had to guess either way, do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way, as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?
This answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years; otherwise we would have heard radio waves.
The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long, but destroy themselves.
Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.
We will take it as a salutary warning, I think, for the rest of our conference this week.
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today.
